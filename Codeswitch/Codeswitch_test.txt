kau tahu kan the chalet we slept is tengahtengah laut eh is at hujung depan dia laut pokokpokok pasir ris park
so what happened was the dia punya laptop computer is inside a cupboard so the lecturer needs the key to open up certain things in order for him to play the project plan everything him being him
the the contrast between the two movies so the friend yang shaun the sheep keluar dia masuk balik kan kita tengok final destination five dia macam wow you guys ah asal tengok one cerita to the other tapi kita tengok pun ketawaketawa but that was one of the best ni lah

pamper eh macam on twitter we see the baby spa then they are not paying back

and then like when pakai handphone then like very dekat
then cause the betina punya anak dia ada anak kecil like around the same age as my cousin then kecilkecil dah pakai specs then i scared later like dia orang kat sana tak jaga my cousin betulbetul then like all the bad habits macam tak terjaga sia
okay ill make a guess mungkin sgag
cause sampai sekarang kan i dont know the difference between dam dengan chess wait chess is the one dengan the horses things right

levels like what period in time of your life macam you
i only spent two year dekat sana
abeh ada ikan bilis or
so you nak pakai ini forever
malas girl you
wah like you can really see macam mana orang turn out to be seh
there were like macam camne nak cakap eh
kita boleh like
maybe cause i nak cookie
and it doesnt help cause like my way of co commuting is uh to naik bus what then bus selalu ada macam they take the longer route what so thats why ah
mesti dia macam i remember dah penat
tapi aku takut because i need like macam time to try it out
macam model it out you know takut dia macam for sizes and all so
advise me on the sizing and then macam so what kind of design people is interested in
because you know instagram ada yang promote punya function tapi kena bayar  aku tak ada duit dah lah aku tak
i saw one kedai dorang jual tote bag like
 macam pathetic ah to me no offence its not like high skill level embroidery but its like sixty dollars and people all buy and its like sold out im like oh my god like i can do so much better
apa ni bendabenda simple gitu
so dia cakap tak akan aku nak charge mahalmahal tapi dia cakap
so kau kau beli pastu dia jahit pastu you can
kita more to macam a sustainable lifestyle
local atau secondhand atau thrift tapi
if you think about it thrifting and secondhand atau hand me down dia macam kau kau selalu kasi aku baju kan kau tak nak pakai kau kasi aku baju pasal
ya actually aku tak beli baju baru lah actually pasal
you give me i i wish orang lain pun ada this kind of macam relationship with friends atau macam ka macam
nyai aku selalu kasi aku baju pasal dia orang kampung kan dia orang kampung boleh gather baju abeh dia tak suka atau dia besar kecil
bad tapi susah lah kan tapi ya i also dont have macam
much to say other than macam kalau aku ada baju aku kasi kau  tu jer
kalau if you really look from the root kan kau macam oh my god i cant believe i throw that after one use you know
belajar lah just educate yourself all this knowledge is important actually
we we can lagipun kita bukannya sustainably more aware jer i think we just more aware of everything
satu satu pending belum bayar
macam kat manamana advertisement tu or what
explore page nanti ada keluar kan
aku tengok dorang thats why aku nak macam i think thats a good thing about social media kau tengok alamak what am i doing so kau pun
size dia panjang sikit sling dia abeh its like big

tu lah actually kau tahu farah lola kan dia punya design satu jer
post kat dia punya story abeh like a few crochet philippine punya account also quite cute ya
arts arts kalau tak ada pandemic pun orang tak nak tapi the need for it lah
cause ada ni kan  jamil is it is that what you call her
dia cakap dia buat macam six video or whatever ah like macam ya
lets say he he he want to macam argue no lelaki pun but no dont even argue because
pekikpekik makimaki each other tapi dia cakap dia theres theres one thing he say very like really got to me he say if you cannot
dah dah degree semua eh
to claim it lah cause paya lebar kan ada cisco certis cisco kan
ah but apa ni
engkau ah siol 
eh malays be like eh kejap eh jangan main main
be yourself ah kita nak centre parting ke kita nak uh apa parting ke
yang ni macam pocong ni like macam ni
so you work what as a what macam a assistant
there are some of our friends also dorang masih belum tengok
dah hundred and twenty million dah
especially kalau kau buat coding atau math kan theres definitely
tend to be like some parts where macam oh wait whats going on i dont understand sia and then you have to seek for help from other people its not its not the same as like poly atau atau secondary school tau
after one year then kau kena reenroll
if you havent get a academic warning then asalkan your gpa is not lesser than two point o or maybe one point eight then youre still save lah
dekat tempat kerja ni yang gaji dia bagi tujuh ribu abeh kau sekarang tengah kerja kat tempat kerja ni yang bagi kau seribu lapan ratus
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset macam oh since i have this mu much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that i have wanted since i was a kid
dorang suka letak macam orangorang biasa dalam the movie walaupun that movie ada banyak orang macam superpower kan tapi dorang buatkan character tu macam he goes through everyday life as per normal but uh they somehow macam in a turn of events they stumble upon something which ma made them into a superhero of some sort even though ada orang dorang tak ada super ah superpower tapi a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something yang buatkan kau macam strongly
so youd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work kalau tak kan kalau kau ikut jer it will definitely not work
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience macam budakbudak lima tahun sepuluh tahun kan kalau kau buat game macam gta five dorang main ke i mean
its weird lah it its weird ah cause tak pernah dengar orang ah eh mana kubur kau bukan kau ah mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa oh dekat mars ah aku nak merawat 
and then oh ya then after that in the morning  just now cause i tertidur so at the sofa you guess what your son did
oh ya then after that the my cermin mata jatuh on the floor tapi i macam half awake half macam  like still  still in the daze ah so after that he took the cermin mata from me and then he did the bend thing
ya lah every time when that happened he will keep on saying take abang take abang ill be like no not a chance you already make a mistake why will i like give you something
again abeh macam mana nak dabao makanan
okay tomorrow jajan is twenty dollars
tadi kita start dalam pukul eleven
okay lah im sure theres a lot of things to talk about okay lets talk about um apa nak cakap eh mm
ya because i was busy at home if im at mamas house im usually like talking to nenek and mama
i cannot believe we have to gossip for a good end ah one hour  but its okay these are all juicy details so at least people will actually be entertained when they dengar and dia macam wah actually this couple quite interesting we have to vet this we have dude come on this is not a chore
singtel like macam very elite so they like think like they know they top notch so they they like like
kaki i tangan i rabak seh kaki i pun sama
syamel yang nyanyi lagu i dont know his song ernie zakri ernie zakri
we are the hardworking we are the hardworking student who actually give an hour no im very sure its an hour lah i dont know why you keep saying six minutes six minutes is the content of mother tongue faham tak
no actually we we did a very good job in mixing both melayu and english together
and then ya mama loves to watch tv alhijrah punya news because the news all like macam
lily give birth with seluar
ya so complicated and technically he already lafaz cerai
when he said that no he put a syarat he said that if you go and see your father
because talak will jatuh as long as your syarat is tunai technically dia punya syarat dah tertunai tau pasal dia cakap macam gitu he said kalau what did he say ah something like kalau
ustaz or as in like rom ah
no uh ya tadi pun nenek berbual pasal rumah
tu yang tadi one of the parents say
ya maybe i can sit bila aura tak nak duduk
tak perasan ah then how would mak know that is someone put the
tengok ah baju dorang semua like design like meh ya
huh pukul four thirty kot oh dia muntah dia muntah like phlegm muntah
mothercare tu eh mothers pula mm uh huh oh you scared of what later lah babe
like if that got lost or literally nothing ya and then like you give a little girl a branded bag people would want to steal it though kan like like you know like if orang desperate gila punya
like for a really long period of time i mean module tu macam cause eba very frustrating cause it has nothing to do with our course which is early childhood so nothing to do kan so you learn a lot more to macam business more like
tak boleh keluar cause manamana pergi tak ada duit
do like i i i just like to get it over with macam
one corner kau there duduk kau boleh cikgu pun orang bila cikgu bagi time kat kelas untuk buat project kau just duduk jer apa habis tidur
tak buat kerja kan i mean kau do kerja yang you are given kau boleh dapat a even though gonna work is like so bad
they really think about their ranking a lot lah macam i know that some macam
my friend sawar she hasnt really think about ranking lah but shes clever but rela also clever but she also dont think about ranking macam kita
so end up you jadi cikgu atau jadi principal more of that but then
it it is a very stable job cause obviously that job is not gonna that job cannot be taken by robots that kind of stuff so it is a very stable job everybodys gonna like end up like being a teacher so macam that stability is what people want in life kan
cause like at one point you realise that a lot of your learning is due to rephrase the words macam there are some things about ah what we learn about like theory psycho analytic theory this kind of stuff is where theres id super ego and then like ego that kind of stuff is where we learn how like you know like theres macam kat movie
now like macam honestly okay at eighteen right ah when i turn eighteen of my birthday i did a video call with my friends
and eighteen kan kau obviously kawan kau bukan semua ada boyfriends kan sekarang jer kan oh ajak kawan ada theyre going out dia orang keluar kat boyfriend dia orang lepas tu dia orang go to the beach even kat covid covid ni dia orang text sahaja its just like ugh i want that i want that but theres no one to have that with but i want that
like aku boleh tidur pukul sembilan pukul lapan siang
i feel i i want a boyfriend but im not gonna die if i dont have it cause im fine now like aku tak ada boyfriend tau macam
me and my siblings grew up separately so we all came together kan kita macam really emphasise my dad my dad really like
kau boleh end kan tapi family kau will always be there with you and you need to understand because kau dah besar you are adult
then kita kena bagi like my siblings just like macam uh tanya like they never ask
that wasnt like what tu bukan masa aku mudamuda tau tu last year tau sasha knew about this like apa tu
like everybody knows kita punya reputation tapi takde takde portfolio in this this sort of thing so they will also thinking why not maybe you hold a weekly event dulu
prizenya tak banyak it is seriously tak banyak actually so the regist total registration fee will be its ten dollars per person jadi the whole prize pool eh baru apa enam ratus six hundred and forty
namanya d to de sports league entah siapa i langsung tak pernah dengar aku tak pernah dengar dia orang punya ni tapi ada nine hundred plus members kat dalam
actually nak kata possible eh
correct so you masuk kalau you masuk quarter final sudah dapat five percent you masuk semi final you get ten percent
correct correct we can even up the champion to thirty percent pun boleh thirty percent of the total prize pool
my understanding is that he has his own production punya house or something like that
you know tapi the one problem kan that i can see is that if well go to him to look for sponsors that is definitely basically is a scoga event or is a scoga sponsored event scoga duit no problem this is definitely their alley they were one more i err jet ideas
loudmouth partners loudmouth partner kita sure but its not kita joined loudmouth and we we work under lock mouth
i macam mana nak kata uh ada orang kata a lot of times at people sponsor benda kan they dont actually get anything much out of it
i think ya i think in the end tu nak buat sponsor tag ah in the end
dia kerja dhl
is tetap macam korang dua orang jer kan in a dark place also she shes not comfortable with it so
when i told when i told people about this right when i told my friends about what he did ni semua kan
it is not really easy to say lah okay its not easy to say because we do not know ah what are the experiences that ah you know people uh i mean orang orang orang experience

uh and s streamers uh aku tengok mostly streamers pakai the ini ah secret lab one

the different type of culture semua
but then yang ini okay ah yang you know those kanjiro kind
err so err i i i went to sungei buloh with my friend so bangun pukul tujuh setengah pastu gi mandi err makan sarapan sikit then uh saya uh keluar rumah so i i met my friend we went to sungei buloh we took a we just keep on walking we walk and talk at the same time
err semalam uh i spend like almost for the whole day at ntu err i was studying for my studying for my exam for my finance exam so most of the time err kat kat ntu lah belajar jer sampai from pukul satu sampai pukul enam gitu
ya i suka
ya mendung err a bit sejuk and its just nice weather ah
even though i do agree that err theres a smaller percentage of malay people who go to university but err to local universities but i know like theres actually a lot of my peers from secondary school who goes the poly then uni route so they still end up in a in a uni is just that they may have gone to err macam public uni ah i mean local uni or private uni but they still go to uni
subsidised subsidised heavily subsidised for public schools tapi when you talk about those non like err like we have certain schools in singapore yang macam the fees very expensive kan so usually like all the rich families will be able to go but not err for those families yang macam tak boleh afford lah because the fees are very expensive even like um macam if you want to join some of the cca you have to pay more
ah education is free for all especially when you when when we are talking about those lower income families yang macam or those like err families yang macam  rumah tangga ada masalah uh mak bapa tak boleh beri uh tak boleh kasi apa tu uh apa tu tolongan pertolongan kepada uh apa tu anakanak mereka so i think this is where it will be nice lah if the err those families uh those kids um can
because sekarang macam buat split teams kan then its like theres two offices were like were not supposed to cross then we handle macam cuma two units each lah so kita punya outside unfortunately macam banyak 
so uh so then macam then she also has to handle the clients kan the office the the program that i am in and then the other program she err she also has to attend to the matters there lah so macam double work
full time lah macam err how to say ah they ask me to apply tapi macam a bit weird lah macam i was telling one of the colleague macam the colleague there lah the staff there there was like
my the reporting officer shes actually supposed to be macam less
so dia teringatingat the families ah or what how is your relationship with their family lah that kind of thing
 but i think macam they try to push lah macam reduce the amount first of all and then second it cannot be that macam is singular case work lah it must macam kita buat group work or something considered under the kpi lah because macam fsc
oh no no theres no need to itu i have to i apply the usual route lah

macam apa itu
i think i dont know lah macam something to do with our ears like usually when we
like you dont expect the husband to like do so much of like housework or anything is macam financially sahaja lah kasih duit 
ya but at the end of the day macam but if you is good lah kalau you only want to have like one kid sahaja but then kalau you want anak kedua ketiga then when is it going to stop

you mean so angry at the world or your attendance masalah
ya tapi mind boggling because yang that time somehow ya saya kena roped into the story kan jadi i was also confused lah apa tengah jadi ni then err girlfriend nama dia pun ada mention my name
yang masa tu juga dia ingatkan lelaki tu macam buaya
apa mm mungkin dia tak begitu confident dengan dia sendiri ataupun dia punya relationship dengan lelaki tu jadi
err saya rasa saya tak sepatutnya tanya eh bilang awak tak apa lah nama dia orang semua tapi ni jer lah yang saya boleh bilang awak
tapi
 saya pun confused ah tengok bualbual pasal apa ni okay tapi tapi saya faham lah saya faham awak kena ah
tangan saya berdarah dengan saya tak nak um

lambat sangat apa kata apa kata kita move on to the next question awak lambat sangat eh
ya ya ya ya takde kawan banyak then recess tak makan sendiri
um tak beli makan no no the fas that point of time wasnt that really you know a thing you know they dont really give to just everybody you know and then
 mengecewakan
awak seorang jer menang ticket tu
i think i like documentaries my favourite cause i like to know facts or like uh know whats going on it is seram but thats thats um
bila kita kat dunia kita
tengah crossing the road tapi saya tak tolong sebab
atau awak lebih suka cergas like you know kadangkadang kita nak keluar kita
tak boleh fit in our pants you know we wear shirts and were like we have to cover up properly cause
the one at the pandan gardens there
so dia memang uh friend of a friend is it
apasal kena dekat istighfar eh
ya ya but that dont you see macam that is the thing that orang just always pick and choose what they want suiting what they want of the religion to suit what they just pick and choose what they want of the religion to suit what they need it to suit you get what im saying part part nak kahwin cepat macam oh ah ikut sunah nabi percepatkan but part part lain macam
uh anyway this boy the call you abang or what 
we feel youre not ready about marriage because what do you expect macam do you expect it to be something that you will be led by this man who is has her leadership character whos spur and can lead you to be a better muslim blah blah blah
macam because by right this is the age where she should be exploring her identity and she finds herself tau this twentieth uh twenty some age
habis if i were to ever raise it up  of course it will never go down very well in this
okay you fetch her daripada woodlands
abeh wait dia naik motor kan tak eh
i find it senang nak bawa okay ah alone lagi senang nak bawa tapi kalau ada pillion susah sikit
tak apa nak buat aku tak nampak the the post
ya macam kau dengan fazirah jer
ah bagus bagus dia nya psychology bagus
ah ada banyak subject ah then after that macam dorang specialise in whatever subject they want to specialise in ah
pasal kira kau exco satu tahun after that kau dah tak exco lagi then actually kau tak payah know all ad hoc
okay maybe in the future then tak payah aku rasa in the future macam sekarang still kena ah cause
ye lah okay its not fair cause macam
cause then mak dia punya side macam mana like
lets say kalau race ikut bapa dia dia tak macam melayu tapi dia bukan melayu pe actually dia mix still mix what
kau dah besar kau nak beli rumah apa
ada ada satu ah apa lagi satu pintu kat atas theres two gate satu pintu
i dont know ah i i mean aku macam tak nak beli private housing
ya so kalau aku ada duit pun aku maybe tak akan beli private property ah
betul tu tak rapat sangat tu time kecil rapat tapi after that kita macam
sorry eh aku tak taruk nama tak taruk nama takut aku nya members dengar gitu
ya lah aku ada ni ah
gossip ah kira macam banyak cerita ah
banyak cerita ah like kau tengok semua orang ada cerita
semalam amar kata tak dorang dah tak kira breakup
kalau kau date somebody your social circle yang rapat kan susah kau low key macam mana pun orang akan tahu
semalam irfan pun cerita sekali dia nya cerita
kau sakit kan hati dia 
irfan macam tak tahu ah macam confused juga ah macam suka ke tak ni kan
macam hi faz abeh senyum macam 
beli ah uh intercom
curry aku ingat ada curry roti jala
eh kalau korang tak ada tak ada prac lagi submission merepek macam
boleh ah two hundreds words jer tak ah tak panjang
sort of ah aku macam aku nampak nama irfan then aku macam
got to this idea nak buat tahu begedil
i didnt realise yang how hard it was until um they got a review lah somebody wrote a review then cakap
i think it was because i was sick then i realise ugh you know what if only i can become a doctor and then um i just got the idea from a lot people lah one thing i wanted to become scientist also pasal that time pergi madrasah then after that my ustazah cakap apa
dia punya apa apa dia cakap dia punya le
because when i was in jc i was i was so i was always late and then every time i kena punished and i dont like to be punished then everytime before because i know l
boleh because dia dia tak ada the pricing tau for that thing so they just like anyhow give me a price so i said i dont mind then the next day i said even that not enough i brought my own water bottle i want your masala chai in my water bottle 
i dont know maybe protein shake ah  not protein shake lah the one the one yang ada all the all the meals like
then the guy was saying like um they were in the they were in a vessel uh but then after that they will makan some like some bubur or like porridge ke apa benda
i also not so sure pasal to me dia macam nampak macam dancing
im using that person okay so lets say this person tanya okay ayisha uh can i uh macam stay at can i stay at your place for two weeks
you either macam 
but they dont understand apa tu yang
its not the language yang kita belajar in school
err kalau we we i moved to his house kan at least nak pindah to our new house its lagi dekat lah i mean you have to you know shuffle between west and east to to move the barang
the budak the kids confirm like you you send one invitation is not two people come is satu family
for me i think like oh because kita buat combine and it is a location that can provide a lot macam for the one at orchard right
im not say concern but just tutup one eye lah for the because like its for a big day you see so you shouldnt worry about that and lagi pun
understand that you know its its not by choice i mean tak yah by choice lah but then theres a limit to the choice so
jauh in the sense of distance lah not is in terms of family tree so macam like there was one example that my friend she just got married like uh think two months ago
got married um in ibloom apa ni belum
on top of the wedding tau because it seems that for what i read like this couple has been together for so long but nearly ten years so because dah kenal lama
this one tahu they say that you know if lets say theres another event right after your event lah we will have to clear out
no one week ago so ya so one week ago i tak warm up lah it was really stupid i forgot to warm up and then i just angkat berat then i felt like macam a sharp pain in my back then i was like oh no
oh did she say if tak sakit eh 
um like consultation dia sahaja dah
 oh my god my laughter is so cringe nanti orang transcribe
and padahal and i think in a way not that it always makes sense for the girl to move in with the guy until they can find a house tapi macam is easier pakai tudung leceh you know if you were like
pergi sekolah so dia kata
dia dia yang boleh kita pergi rumah kak ogi
si kecil tu at least kak ogi jumpa juga lah once and then ayah tu jumpa kan
tapi kesian juga kalau macam gitu okay kalau macam gitu
tak ada lah dia ada cakap apa semalam wasnt supposed to be the timing to do homework
dia ada dia punya own timing
if you he teach at these two uni duadua uni dia ajar
ya lah so for example the other time dia pergi m mdis
so unless you want to open up lah and say okay go maybe australia ke mana
so with that diploma kalau dia masuk kat tempat lain
tapi ya lah dia at the end of the day apa
resources pun
session tu yang i told ira ira kalau lets say parents datang they already want to sign up you dont have to send them for the  diagnostic session ah i cakap
if they can pay by cash because right now alr already its its apa tu orang cakap err
actually tak ya at at first i i i i was thinking about ya lah financially we are still quite a burden but after that i was like  i have to stop worrying ah you know
dorangnya buku sekolah lah lah buku madrasah lah apa benda nak kena beli
but your work wise memang dah
asam orh kunyit ah but tapi kunyit hidup ah jangan pakai kunyit powder
aku ya i always mix with water then i just drink it as a shot
serious lah kalau dah artiste mesti lah better
 cute lah masih cute lah juga hasif tak tau dia berbual macam orang besar dia dah macam more naggy now maybe because im naggy or his brother is naggy lepas tu dia and then he he like
i think so ya because sometimes err aku punya neighbour ni dia sekolah dekat kranji juga kadangkadang dia balik lambat dia tak naik three zero seven dia ambil lagi satu bus and then it drop behind aku tak tahu
cause macam those rumahrumah yang baru kan the layout ya the the the layout is funny and then like if youre opening you open the window to a to another window that kind of thing aku macam like ya exactly pasal tu pasal we say resale the best thats why resale punya prices is still
jauh ah aku dah aku dah kat sini dah bagus tau cause of a southview kalau aku nak ada rumah dekat sini aku nak block sana nampak harihari aku pandang block sana block mak mertua aku block sebelah situ mak mertua aku nya block macam block aku dia ada rumah empat bilik dekat situ ada ada em dengan ea yes correct then yang kat hujunghujung is ea ada tapi mahal
nak tolong ajar ke nak tolong exactly
i mean i have tukar topik ah like  i have troubles
boring gila
nak buat sia
like no see thats the thing theres a lot of patient customers out there like kalau kau ajak fight dah dua jam then tu lain cerita ah or the worse one is
tu lah like err initially i was like
lima soalan jer lepastu saya harus jawab kan dalam masa empat puluh lapan jam ye puanpuan
faham jer cause like
ya ya ya ya oh my god oh my god faham faham faham faham macam like oh you you have this kind of like ya ya ya
 faham faham faham
they never re ya they they hantar surat like they never really meet cause
um the suami ah masih belajar dekat medina so um
ya taking it slow but then it was actually not that slow ah i think they they kenal for like tiga bulan
ya they dont really macam buy into that
ayam masak merah no i want to eat ayam again
alah cook whatever you want lah i pun tak tahu
mungkin boleh have to cook rice then you going mama tomorrow
ya you already say iya ke all these
no lah that wont be so bad lah bukannya hempashempas handphone
if ya lah if you get a good house dah siap untung ah
it can be it can be two way you know because i also hear that people also divorced couple uh divorce because spending too much time together and then they cannot tahan each other ar uh yeah
so ill be ya so they were they they were like my kaki my elder brothers you know
okay lah its just satu hari jer apa right monday
anyway can there be a macam
okay lah macam homecoming ah gitu
mak dia tak pakai mask
businesses wise i think um  i think between businesses and societal macam thirty seventy
the and all these case lah basically macam dia orang punya wifi bukannya strong kan like you know you have a lot to handle
i think definitely the biggest loser is like the orangorang tua who are staying in their who are staying on their own that is really the biggest loser because
unless lah got one pokok pisang dekat in the middle of the north south line from yew tee to kranji
ke wild boar dekat dekat sembawang mrt
were these animals obtain kan and so kalau macam theyre like exported from overseas then definitely the home country where is being released 
err kalau ada wish eh
okay lah dia macam probation period dah rupa gitu
tak kasi dia keluar
ya sebab sekolah lama seh like you you school like continuously right
so sekarang ni twenty twenty jadi next year
maybe in two to three years then im like okay lah kau fikir dulu lah
 tu dia punya tu tight sikit dia punya schedule dia tak boleh lambat
its always because of like macam
wah cepat seh
dorang punya living conditions got raised up as well which i think is a positive side effect of this i mean im not gonna say that its a good thing but there are some positive side effect is like one of them is like this macam dormitory is only now baru tahu oh dulu kan dorang tinggal then after that i was thinking
oh my god how macam mana tu
before we go to the next question i want to ask macam
we ngamngam 
so macam aku rasa macam sekarang like budak i mean not to generalize okay but like budakbudak sekarang is more
aku rasa macam sebab macam singapore kan dia uh nak tinggal dekat sini memang mahal gila apa
i think pressure in terms of like macam kahwin ke tak kahwin ke macam marriage lah so i think
buat kerja the assignment and all the
ya dont dont buy two or three ikan at one shot and then after that keep for few days
tak tak pernah tak pernah
the malay teacher ah cikgu
but now as age catch up you dont really recognize him until somebody pointed out then eh isnt that err cikgu ahmad said then eh
sayang we are the millennials sayang
adi is secular adi is madrasah then after that he went to secular but for no ahmad is err all the way is
tu ah pasal hari raya bukan dapat tengok dia orang

pecahkan they want to pecahkan and nak buat rumah baru but its like dia orang tak nak move because they were miskin kan so its like apa tu
apa apa no penanggal penanggal lain do you realise its the same thing because nananggal is the philippines term for penanggal penanggal is melayu
you know zaman dulu is yang apa tu tali dia hanging kan kat atas it wasnt underground like now kan ya so basically singapore ha kat jb kat malaysia tak lah kat singapore lah so basically like apa tu they had to change dia punya lines kadangkadang kalau kadangkadang dia uh telephone lama dia orang kan rosak then he was one of the people who go and repair
ha they practise ah but i dont remember what was the reason i know i know err orang minyak is to be good looking or something
they said they use it for kalau orang kena rasuk ke kena rasuk kena apa tu kena hantar apa tu sihir ke they use the daun or something i dont remember this one daun they even sell sabun or like sabun because who want to buy daun and go and clean yourself

motor kuat bro
so my neighbour i think tingkat dua we stay at the fourth floor so at night i think pukul sepuluh ke apa there was somebody who came over to their house macam you know the makcikmakcik jual keropok err they went at ten o’clock why do you open the door to a person who selling things right but my neighbour go and open ah so it it was a makcik selling cake tunjuk the cake all that so macam my neighbour kasihan then my neighbour pun beli lah the cake

then after a few years you kena tukar kan ya ours is granite but now got a lot of new new types of counter top my parents is using this thing called vulcan i also just first time i heard of it masa kita orang pergi id thats why its like um its
we like the house punya location you know bawah theres a direct bus to town then you look over you can see like some greenery tak you dont see like into neighbour punya rumah so nak cari like really our criteria susah
so thats why bawa dia lah pergi wash hands semua pastu keluar dia nampak lego jer terus macam hundred and eighty degrees turn ah like oo whats this pastu ambil then usually for all these kids they will run with my lego they will play with mine because mine is construction set so that its relatable to them but if they see taufik punya dorang tak faham
ya kalau dekat schools nak deal with the parents pastu to them they will think that its okay but it its actually like not okay for other kids you know and then they will learn from each other wah macam mana seh mm ya lah that one is also like my last priority
but then in the end i still macam spend that amount that i work for

some friends also they start you know some some of them do business lah like they bake and then sell some of them for themselves lah but at least it gives you time to to to learn something new you so you ada whatever lah

but her brother actually err studies in ntu and err did err did her his master in ntu something like that then the brother got married to a singaporean girl err so to cut the story short dia cakap dengan aku lah eh uh you kan orang melayu kenapa you tak stay kat malaysia err i think you should
err take this opportunity to work in malaysia i think you would try you will thrive very well in malaysia then you got me thinking eh apa dia cakap tu maybe there is a certain truth you know because kat sana aku perasan orang melayu wah babe privilege babe
i mean kl is a very hustle and bustle city lah but the expenses there is mahal nak mampus
one body shower macam dove eh twenty four ringgit eh siala twenty four ringgit when you pay when you pay fifty ringgit to pay for the twenty four ringgit and when you left with that balance eh macam kiwak macam eh this is very expensive leh but when in singapore
ah sia aku macam siala i mean
eh aku tak hitam kita sawo ma kita sawo matang kulit kita is sawo matang
in school i am like quite err the abangabang but
wei babe dia sampai err dia he actually
engkau ah kalau you see eh if you are sakit kau tak payah fikir tau benda begini you dont even have to think about all these all you think is about your preparation to meet

err actually i pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition i failed my medical thats why aku tak aku tak dapat uh jadi err air steward as well ya so in the end in the end i so you you see how how it all ties up lah how it all times ties back together
ya i know right macam nasib kentang kan  macam theres always something there to  to you know but its okay ya ya i know know ive heard of it before lah this phrase i know i know
exactly you know hes very divi divisive lah dia punya talking eh dia punya words eh that he say uh selalu make people uh fight each other 
ya but i but no aku rasa its not that much of uh how do you put it eh macam  i i dont know what the currency is like uh the standard of living and the cost of living over there over there but from what im seeing eh it seems that everybody is okay leh dia orang macam tak
apparently dia cakap dia nak kena jumpa mp hari ni
ikan sepat masin
lemak lemak cili padi telur masak kicap
because in her team kan ada macam leader tau
apa dia cakap
so hari ni siapa buat all these err like math questions
so dia dont love the husband anymore
ni wife punya bapa
no its not about the episodes its about the way they run the show like the <unk> was so good ya the story line was so good tapi after awhile its just so merepek
we watched that so many times and i still cry tu so sekarang im watching cerita reply nineteen ninety eight have you watched that
mm you can go there lah because my sisterinlaw kamifie kan dia dulu ada ah macam like yours ah acne like that kan
so after that she said macam okay ah lets do it lah just go national skin centre and then within three months kan the skin really clear up you know
oh ya cystic habis that one see
i use i do a lot of things back then macam one of those
dia nak apa
ah dia pernah so dia pernah date dengan kakak fadiyah
tapi ayah ada eh
there tengok lah ibu tengok dia cakap apa ini dia yang mata colour lain
 aiyo cantik seh
why ibu dah kurus
ya but dia punya oil dia is still
dia beli paper box ke tak
then you just mat mm ah pakai makeup kat atas ah
dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus mm so i stay over this view whereby teleportation ac could actually increase
bergaul dengan orang untuk mem untuk memahami keadaan orang
sebab tanpa kita me ber bergaul dengan orang we will never know what they face
macam apa mm macam nak date other chicks or what
like tak ready because of money ya
macam kalau kau sakit ke apa kan ada disease siapa kau tak tahu apaapa kau datang singapore singapore can like handle it you know
 suburbs is like farm area macam all the rural ah ah ah like rural area like people
serious tak joke ni betul kalau ada orang dengar ni confirm dorang cakap aku pernah ni pak cik pak cik confirm tahu punya
tapi err i err aku rasa  ramai orang ada misconception especially after rich crazy apa
but the funny thing was apparently there are rumours yang cakap rumah tu bukan kat singapore
okay k k salah salah
and then after that i came back i oh okay so this is the scene ah ah ah oh ni scene dia abeh apa dah jadi uh oh ya so i didnt really focus but i kind of know macam dia punya jalan cerita
alamak aku tak ingat ah
eh tapi yang the one that i was the  the one i was so disappointed eh was a quiet place
sakit hati tak dapat tengok its not released
apa i forgot ah split personality gitu macam
uh okay i had actually aku tengok this youtube video tau err this this theres this girl lah aku tak tahu ah
yes thats the okay honestly when aku first heard of it eh i was like
as each alter has their own um role macam theres the protector
cause kalau beli rumah besar sikit boleh rental income so i can meet one of the agent yang i kenal which is my friend lah
lembulembu ni yang ada itu
oh tak apaapa nama dia is is not its a adalah i kind of forgotten the name of the mosque
you will find this small macam
a lot of them and also there are other specialty kan its actually ayam rebus and dia punya ayam its actually they take the whole
from the apartment i play with the snow for i mean dia punya snow dia punya snow is tak banyak must wait for the night time then we go to the
winter clothings lain
tetapi their fusion food macam betulbetul tak kena dengan tekak orang melayu even dengan tekak orang putih they dont like cause um when you
um you can practise the real okinawan punya punya martial arts ah punya ni karate cause even
so kirakan okinawan punya kata is actually more
but orang jepun dia punya kata
dia akan blur dia akan tak tahu apa nak bikin
ah dia punya guru dia they dont like to take a lot of people so thats why okinawan punya karate lamalama is dying out
that is the true essence of okinawan punya karate
aku nak rumah percuma aku nak kereta percuma
cause for healthcare dah ada pernah personal experience ah kalau dekat singapore you do not have any insurance apaapa jadi dengan you ah
is actually pasal orang paling kuat achilles
texts yang panjangpanjang semua
kalau whatever ive been through is actually is for my own good also
ah so cause also apaapapun nak kena see
err i juga suka pergi gym i like
going by that thought process kalau gitu mungkin i pun nak ah good looks ah sebab
habis lah jadi
aku rasa fit body lebih penting lah sebab untuk err general health and wellbeing kan
err mereka suka peluk semua kan jadi like this kind of like easily transmitted disease through contact
boleh read people better lah
dalam scenario macam public speaking depan err banyak orang
i feel like kalau any problem aku hadap
err gym kalau aku penat ke apa my next my next set i can just err keep staying positive motivate myself in my mind i focus on my goals and i just pursue them
besides gym lah like err bola ke like next time nak kerja ke anything in life like i i feel like ni ni benda ni confidence dengan yang positive tu err sangat penting lah but ia bukan skill yang
oh third one macam like err its like a positive mindset you have like a optimistic outlook on life you know yourself worth you know you know why you belong and you you are self driven self motivated
your health pun lebih baik um
boleh menjadi sesuatu yang
i tak dapat jadi i nak kasih orang lain untuk experience especially athlete athlete yang masih muda masih ada potential untuk
dia memastikan yang i masih aktif lah bila i dah tua nanti
i bukan nak masuk pertandingan ke apa i just like for casual for enjoyment like
takde glow thats what i meant takde glow
kat mana seh
but kalau kau dah start kerja nanti
oo dengan dia nya instructor semua ah
and then some more my our pay is seventh of the month right so aku submit
but this is not the case thats why when i see her macam one point nine is not enough sia
huh dia dia punya ni
was minta kena sepak sia 
cause you are thirties right do you feel the pressure from your parents kalau your parents ada pressure you
okay so so so basically macam ive watched cobra kai ive watched err i mean i dont tend to watch the series ah i would watch like documentaries or macam movies ah so like social dilemma was another thing i watched recently which was pretty interesting ah
orang pakistan kat sini will be like
that sort of thing ah macam it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesnt even have a say as to who shes married to ah but of course i mean
a still somewhat rare for the whole majlis from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like masjid mawaddah
something that that was on her mind like macam eh why are we doing it in the mosque abeh macam like oh i want to invite only these few people and of course now because of covid you are forced
you know landed correct correct but i think in a way macam at the end of the day  you just have to be
okay i i think roughly around at that point aku dah macam
okay let me google this michael scofield mati
grill chicken pasta otah lah basically then ayam
ya then they have ikan dori
ya so um ya lah so macam uh as of now he keep on saying macam dont worry dont worry tapi macam you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like um that is your family obviously you say dont worry ya
um i mean people have their own perspective and opinion lah but i think for those who support with the current winner apparently kena kena kata orang kena trashed kena slammed
so this man is like actually just killed his wife with the hell out dia punya wif err wife remarried so hes not happy go and killed both of them
i think in us is not something new ah because before that dia ada tunjukkan eh err lot of accidents or orang gaduh eh gaduh all this
some rabak ah rabak gila ah
like you better shut dia macam fine lah you better shut up when were not going to say anything im going to jump on her bag i say okay alright go ahead 
tenyeh kat kau punya kepala kurang ajar ni monyet

oh i see semua busy

and then banyakbanyak then
but i know zul tak comfortable dengan rumi also
unfortunately for his case lah but i think that time zul was with dylan dengan mata air dia ah
so yang kau meet also is those like long route punya sekolah
that time i wanted to lah i die want to cause aku nak main combat combat nak main tembaktembak semua cause
is it the one kat tempat yang yang
bag bag besar tu then kena pergi two different store rooms cause aku kecil gila so aku kena cari aku punya size know campak xs kena ambil dorang dorang campak hel helmet
single bed is not like double deck so i think charlie and delta delta paling worst ah obese kan so delta is the last floor plus dorang bunk bed ya so the entire macam kau tahu the spiral stairs
so aku manage to drink half then aku tak boleh minum then aku
tak boleh kena ada drip lah kat lantai tak boleh macam
 aku first first tengok dia like
abeh rambut aku macam gini tu bila
dia fringe aku tak boleh buat fringe so macam ke tepi macam ni
and then after that know what never mind aku pergi track and field
all youngest cause tahir youngest aku youngest kau youngest so we thought she also youngest she dont give off the slightly older sister vibe
cause we are what nineteen birthday kau dah lepas pe
then i told my mother then my mother like she terperanjat say
 the one yang opposite the tu
ya ya ya betulbetul next to ya fuchun section primary so i think its the new one ya by tak tu kat
so like dari like from primary school uh i was in track and field uh apa nama benda tu  tak tak its not netball
because in poly i joined the percussion punya band
tu bukan gong lah merepek
everytime ada camp kan mesti ada that night walk tau ya and then before night walk they will always show you cerita hantu tau atau cerita seram before that so for that for that one they showed us uh movie the orphan i think
in the tempat eh
its literally next to the madrasah its the i think the  the founder of the sekolah punya family aljunied ya
 kau letak tangan dalam mesti lepas tu ada benda tarik kau 
ya which reminds me of the incredible tales because ada this one episode where
oh amal pengamal oo
maybe ah its one of the ways ah yang ada
uh dia tengah beranak kan and then she saw a white figure then the nurse cakap oh that one is normal usually when people give birth they always see that figure
ya  but then its like damn scary because apa tu
ya its so leceh satu and then its like for the rest of your life or for as long as you are using it kan but for if you go for plastic surgery its like
properties ah then what if its made out of metal atau plastic
err she said like ni orangorang dulu kata ah macam if you are at the funeral kan jangan diri depan kaki mayat because in case kalau bukanbukan kalau like the person pernah ada simpan barang kan they might pass it to you ya so dont like stand i dont know how true this is ah but
ya but i thought like kalau
lagi jauh sia might as well tak yah main sports
macam standard ah cakap english ah okay okay not bad
but also dont need say ah cause kitanya radio our campus radio pun overplayed their songs ah
confirm yes correct betul betul aku agree

mana aku tahu dia selalu dengan matair dia
asal
abeh theres a lot of videos on the instagram now aku tak boleh  tak boleh tak boleh angs
abeh there theres this one like a like a cat was approaching a person the person was like calling the cat in the first place
mak aku dah balik eh mak aku dah balik eh
lets put to malay breakfast nasi lemak

okay lah cause i think it was a joke also cause she was sick what at that time then ah i was i think i was at home or rumah nenek aku abeh aku tengah baring after lunch this one was before our our training start then i saw the message then aku macam eh it cant be ah it cant be aah i think we were practising for oh ya
but ya okay so kan but aku tengok video dia macam kelakar a bit lah but then
and then suddenly like tempat tu very panas you know then dia punya tahap panas until theres a smoke come out of nowhere
dekat ah satu bus jer kot
ah macam tersisih gitu
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take o level but then now i dont know everyone like very ego dont want to come back malu i guess so ya lah tapi ustazah siapa masniah tak salah
was it the apa
when was that bro thats not in bedok actually dekat somewhere else
i nak buat macam a cabinet uh you know macam ada macam gerobok kecil gitu
macam ya lah luas sikit lah tapi 
i yang nak ni apa yang
jap eh jap jap jap jap jap
dont know  okay okay i tanya lagi eh
sertamerta sertamerta is immediately ya or instantly lah
dalam segi uh
suatu hari 
 that dia muda
what like what are the patterns when it comes to code switching like you know like right now im speaking in english and then suddenly i tukar i cakap dengan you bahasa melayu
no lah i rasa i rasa first first christmas
no lah kita kena let kena kena letak dulu pe oh takleh eh
tapi macam tak jer
mari kita lihat
www dot wallhub dot com dot sg mari kita
ni sticker
ya like a black and white wall okay but then like too much eh tu tu dah macam forest sia
jap jap ni tengok dia punya ni 
the store room tu kan that wall i wanted to do we should have hidden the door
where the tv wall is ah ya yang dia letak tv ah
nasi goreng pattaya and i knew it
tak habis kau tak ambil basic theory test
tak dapat sponsor ah i just eh macam ada discount ah aku bayar dulu then my parents pay me back 
not vlogging vlogging macam
tak dengan yang mike mike something
yang we the millers eh
 i know i know ya aku yawn lagi 
i dont mind kalau beli pc tapi macam like for fun sia like i wont joke around
apex legend eh susah best lah kau nak macam tu now got see the cyberpunk the ps four 
tapi its also
apa benda aku cakap berkayak ke apa
ah wait lrt station macam jetty ah jetty
apa two b eh phase three jer lah eh
can yes no problem ya ya theres no problem with that basically the the way they they put it is that because some people prefer macam oh takut kadi err they wanted for morning morning wedding kan so dorangnya ceremony for the nikah pagi so dorang tak nak macam kadi takut jam so kalau katakan they wanted to have a eight am
ya cause i dont want to like miss out on the kadi that i want but eventually on that day itself my kadi was busy so i got the i got his back up ya
ya ke but like what i say when it when it happens to me i think i think you you remember i forgot that there was a reading part
ya ive not met that guy before lah basically ya ya the kadi before but basically then he just give me a call and then ya um but when it comes to your situation itself right once you book the kadi that you want and then set a date with romm
cause i wanted i want to to know what i need ready ya so macam on the day itself if you need to do then oh semua dah siap
when my friends all got married previously all a lot of them got married nikah on a saturday and then wedding on a sunday ya
once its all that okay and then ya then you go out when you are leaving the room and there will be like two kakak there will be asking you macam awak awak kahwin kahwin kita ada marriage prep ni eh err apa for you to go and then you like oh and alamak ni saya bila lah then for me right what happened to me was like dorang cakap ni awak dengan tunang awak boleh sign up ni bagus tau macam very informative and everything lah they were saying all the like like they a give long speech about it i said im too busy ah so then after that then they will shut up
you know but if you have a typical wedding macam kita semua macam orang semua tengah ambil makan buffet kan dorang jalan ambil makan everything kan a lot of the times my friend potong cake orang kat belakang tak tahu then like for me is that okay for some of them it all depends like i said it all depends on the couple lah some couples
is a is a western is a western tradition ya so some people some people say oh i dont cut for everybody to say i cut for me and my wife for that special moment i get it macam okay aku faham but for some people they want to make sure that all the guest see you know macam if you are if you are the kind of person that you want to have a wedding cake and you want everyone to see cause your wedding cakes are not going to be cheap
ya so those those are the things that for me macam important lah nak kena tahu macam
ya so its like err suka hati dia nak makan lah he was kat sini ada makan apa eh you are like kau tanya aku kat fort canning mana aku tahu makan apa kau gi makan cari kedai prata
but but sometimes you dont know how how how good they are sekali they make you look like a nyonya you know that kind of thing you also dont know  ya
at the same time you cannot expect people dah makan jalan ah is okay you also cannot expect dah makan jalan lah you know that kind of thing ah eh kau dah makan angkat pinggan mangkuk jalan lah you cannot do that what right
sit down there ya cause we got no kompang or nothing what
boleh ambil gambar ni boleh sebarang ah like i for me is like for me is like i dont i dont want it to be macam that kind of thing like for me is like i still got time i still got time ya lets go
takkan jadi during the planning i said exactly who exactly who will follow to the letter and first and foremost you do know that your makeup doesnt take macam you have to tell the makeup oh you have fifteen minutes to put on her makeup theres no way if she needs half an hour shes going take half an hour

some dan hari raya

yang bestnya pergi rumah p ramlee tu dia punya
uh huh kita respect lah
manamana kita nak pergi tanya flood ke tak flood ke tak kalau dia kata um ah longer way uh huh
a bit macam odd lah something good
basically is err apa taking pictures

of course lah kadang ada orang selfish apa kan so if
kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini kan then kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat
tergantung its very susah lah then
i am willing to usaha kan and i happen i got a cousin is willing to support lah
and then the assessment pun need another set of ah check up
kan kita bukan im not expect bukan expect dia boleh
pandai kan macam harapkan dia apa dia dapat
tapi orang tak tak pandang dia begitu orang treat dia macam apa

ah bawa adik sekali
banyak benda yang baik lah bermanfaat bukan sahaja untuk kita
mm uh tahun ketiga dua puluh dua puluh dua tahun keempat so maybe ill graduate around twenty twenty two to twenty twenty three ive so its like two more years right i dah plan i i i have planned
oh wait so you tidur sorang ah
macam all the food that abah simpan masih boleh masih boleh pakai seh
i have macam oh okay i like this i dont like that outfit ada lah but macam
um i at the actress some something and then dia macam tak so so present either like ending last season something like that the actress herself macam problematic something like like that lah dia macam dia macam indecisive punk life then dia macam i think so lah there were some like drama whatever contract tak ingat ah something something but
tapi dia bukan transgender
ada cakap kak punya style blair waldorf i tak tahu pun blair waldorf 
tak ingat how it ended i just know they kahwin and hes dia dia macam eh sudah lah dia macam self in love himself too much if thats the thats what i remember i have not watch the show for like so long
tak lah if i remember correctly dia not so bad dia cakap siapa
dia dengan kakak rose ada five similarities
three lah dia orang um perfect skin
jangan frosty lah betul betul lah they wouldnt name their
musa musa musa sporty bukan ke tecna
nina hate wall e  actually kau dah tengok the first thirty minutes i watch the
aku tak tahu dok
weh boring pe tu aku tak boleh okay no matter how good a show is right i will never rewatch uh not that ill never rewatch sebab i wouldnt go until six times three four times
eh even suria dorang tunjuk tau aku macam
oh no the the translation the translation is like very macam so formal right the word
i guess i guess so thats why macam aku tak boleh tengok so i was like geram ah macam shit aku aku ingatkan aku kat malaysia aku boleh tengok so im like ah sedihnya tak boleh tengok because because benda tu kan because benda tu kan tak boleh tak boleh uh jumpa manamana sangat kan so i was like a bit sad ah gitu lagipun macam i thought holiday holiday pun i still got time to watch apa drama kan
no wonder i was like because that time you told us about you were walking at like jurong lake gardens aku macam
bro kau tahu sebab dia ada stages tau bila that simulation kan aku pergi we all had to take turns going ah i try ah because they say when you go you have to like protect yourself ah just anything to protect yourself
kat bawa jer kan but then jatuh juga so like
ya so that should be fine already so thats why ah macam apa nama dia um they just say make sure just protect your head with anything and everything that is hard or like macam wooden ke apa ke as long as you protect your head then it should be fine already
ya then every region i think ada quite a number at least at least two ah ya then now cause sekarang they are all starting to built community hospital
ya so thats why so sekarang dorang dah buat community hospital kat sini so i guess if im not that time aku pergi
mana eh woodlands ke east side east side or north side aku pergi aku pun nampak they are like trying to built something then it looks like macam community hospital also dari luar ah sebab kadangkadang kalau kau tengok renovation kan then nanti dorang akan kepung tempat tu kan
i kind of saw like macam that that thing lah so i was like oh i guess because kalau rumah pun sekarang rumah rumah
ya so its like dia dah mandi kan then dia dia dia tanya aku ah eh ni bau lagi tak aku bau tangan dia macam asal macam bau lagi eh
because our our parents are friends not parents our our mums are kawan baik
so kereta tu dah takde lagi dalam
ya it it became like a campfire thing did we were we arsonists did we burn any macam dustbin tak kan
i think we should say thanks to her ya if err if you know like if i get to see her eh mak long hi remember me she probably wouldnt pasal ya
ya because i realise bila kau malas kau jadi gemuk
err yes and vice versa so every year we will go through that thing so we seldom see each other kita akan jumpa each other bila err macam nak balik sekolah so kau kau balik sekolah aku baru nak pergi sekolah dengan thing sometimes

dia tak ada laki what 
mari kita tengok apa jadi
this the makcikmakcik right
jodoh tak ke mana
boleh lah tapi nanti tapi nanti kan macam susah sikit i dont know like now im watching love island are you on netflix right do you subscribe netflix
so at home you have no no the bilik one can watch the
oh shoot shoot shoot nine fifty one already okay okay okay okay abu mesti makan dia lapar
i think the microphone tangkap banyak
tak cakap banyak sangat
tapi tak dengardengar
tadi tak merahmerah tau
because sometimes when you speak melayu and english its not its not difficult to switch but i mean
bangun pukul ya seven tujuh setengah
ah nenek tu kan tua so macam nenek tu suruh letakkan dekat meja takkan you tak nak letakkan tapi dia punya situation is like so scary and creepy until the delivery rider ya
bangun pagi nak ambil wudhu kan nak solat and then i was taking my ablution and then after that but this was in my mothers toilet because i was scared
then i tengok dekat sebelah
ya then i see again takde
you can actually leave your car over there kan macam
and gelato messina was eh what flavours were there lupa ah
eh but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so macam you know the experience of eating when its cold and youre lapar like that just makes you feel that its the best thing ever
like i remember we came for souvenirs or something else lah like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didnt task was really like we didnt even know about the brownie sebelum tu apa
like like i didnt even know something macam so basic and simple can taste so sedap you know what i mean
alright alright alright so you guys were like itik dengan ayam ah berbual
but when you say community do you mean because you were studying at that time right so when you say community do you just mean that it was like the uni like your circle of friends who you met there or community at large macam like you know the muslim probably like the muslim network outside of your studying
 suka sangat sampai tengok dua kali  eh okay ill like watch that maybe thanks for the recommendation
 like thirty minutes like that yeah but its still manage to catch up on the lessons though lah i can still understand so okay lah but its very hard to focus then very hard to understand also at the same time then like  aku  kan  pemalu  kan so dah lah  nak kena  press the recording  then like its very hard because you dont want to interfere like when the teachers talking and all right yeah its a bit hard ah through ms teams all
quite manageable  tapi macam  one or two modules  susah sebab ada  maths yeah  susah sikit  lah hmm
oh yes like you know like i i was thinking about it i feel like i dont want to  kerja kat  office i think that is so  macam  stressfull because you have to deal with  orang lain  some  orang tak  kan  macam suka kau  you know and then you have to deal with the boss i mean like you may or may not get a good boss you know you never know then yeah i mean like the working hours
burger ramly duh  sedap gila  sia like burger ramly  kat situ lagi sedap dari yang kat  singapore
ha you should try seh  sedap 
its gonna be a struggle for me but i do like  macam  tempu tempura you know  dengan nasi nasi  those breaded kind of food is nice duh like i would defenitely want to try it like that because  macam  authentic kan  macam sedap  ah  dengan dia punya  japanese curry ive never try it
yeah actually maybe because of the place that we go to lah but we did  macam  go to like their old old houses like i dont know how to say
oh my gosh   sekarang dah takde pasar malam  b so boring
so the the problem was uh okay that that was yesterday so aku faham
takpe uh number one you go first i said but i thought you cannot overtake takpe takpe takpe i was number one she was number seven or nine i got number one ah so after that sampai habis
ha plank plank quite senang what
the the the the apa the capacity capacity i think is
wobbly ah lepas tu jatuh ah
tapi its just dangerous sia
so by the time aku dah nak sampai yellow light all i have to do is i just have to stop locating and then steer back down my my rear and and and front brake
the bike actually just drop aku pula yang slide cause it was licin
slow down slow parking macam mana ya
so after i makan already then was i my eleven forty then i text my friend lah he say hey your theory still on ah aku balik dulu ah
sekali aku pergi eleven thirty kan i went to the bus i see the girl like in so long kan then oh bus driver only got twelve oclock then alamak siala
i never see but dayah always try to act like the kakakkakak in the office i cannot i cannot tahan
then after that and then you give me keiths number then when i call keith ask me to come down come down bukan interview sia aku datang terus kerja
aku rasa aku ada ah during that time aku dengan erin dah dah dah on the rock aku rasa aku ada rasa eh
i dont know economic macam image you know like how macam singapore nak
that like banyak banyak gaps a lot of gaps
ya ada
ah mata merah
one of the job that i went apa contact lens packer
ah dia put afan name down as macam guarantor kau tahu kind of thing ah
but did he tell him beforehand ke apa
so how long ago was this and berapa
dia macam degil kind of guy ya
then ah he wafan was saying ya but you know the act of macam more or less youre saying
nanti aku tak boleh focus
but that one also doesnt paint like err macam compete picture juga cause a lot of the citizens dorang punya baseline is met
so what is it about the home wrecker yang
like the underlying issue is still there apa like hes basically not happy
is it dah macam you know like
aku pun nak join his side but i cannot 
oh he ajak me again like todays friday but aku macam
this makes sense aku aku faham
because uh lepas tu like theres no job and nobody call me lah i did the ah aku pernah buat yang apa yang shopping tu eh
i did the one for uh one of the retailers in singapore lah but i have to go its a its a one brand tapi aku kena pergi banyakbanyak outlet tau lepas tu kan
tapi uh do they give you like every okay you are you you are on a every monday and wednesday shift then your colleague is tuesday and thursday that kind no is it
then uh like other  products macam very slow moving so we dont know how long we can sustain
sekali just before i left uh boss dia kena macam apa macam apa tu
then she will be like uh sorry i have a a lunch appointment sorry i have this appointment that appointment lepas tu kalau tidak dia cakap okay dia tolong kan
lagi pergi hong kong siak tu kalau pergi indonesia ke pergi mana mana like okay lah got potential to keep uh at most i pay back the company what
lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku just tell the uh cfo pula tu aku kena bilang
tapi cfo tu baik gila sia dia cakap uh nevermind its okay uh just make sure next time you dont repeat the same mistake ni semua ah blah blah blah that one i was less than three months old in the company you know like i see how much was the ticket
then after dah kecoh gila sekali got one guy and one guy right hes supposed to travel he is from vietnam to singapore he supposed to travel uh with
its tomorrows date dia kata ya so see your flight is tomorrows date tomorrows timing but its the same time as that day lah yang dia nak kena depart kan
and lepas tu macam but after that he was like okay lah tapi he took that opportunity to shoot me back ah in front of my boss dia cakap ah ya she book me on the wrong date
lepas tu macam overlap lepas tu uh bilik pula kau buat ah okay kau buat this hotel room aku buat ni ni ni punya okay
lepas tu macam its so messy i was like oh my gosh
 the whole thing the first person passenger that we finished finalised of its like it was one week before jer dia bilang
tak lepas tu satu kali tu lagi kelakar uh uk passport tau
ya i believe your passport no need visa confident sia lepas tu 
i was like oh my gosh aku tak i cant remember ah uk passport or us passport going to hong kong or
ha ya lah hong kong no need ah aku rasa vietnam ke apa ah
you ask him to do anything dia akan buat punya ah macam very like listen like very obedient small boy like that ah
macam malas

i was like kenapa kau tak nak tanya jer dm jer lah but then he macam malu so i decided to do it

it will normally show up macam kau bila kau tengok story orang kan it will pop up between stories gitu
demand gitu its kind of cool
orang macam minta or whatever
dia ada following so senang in my opinion no offence lah kalau kau ada the following kan
actually um kau tahu kan uh i was considering uh apa tu
kau pernah dengar the term macam as assets liability
so basically uh accountant ni macam keep track of their balances
tudung buka tudung
tu tau 
its not just kita orang fikirkan pasal perempuan jer its that just so happens
kecil i um kecil
its also by ceritacerita macam gini that like promote kita untuk
uh uh kadangkadang kadangkadang problem dia dalam perkahwinan boleh kahwin lagi aku macam

ya about thousand a thousand people also so its like macam that is like one of the biggest regrets because that time it was my wedding i mean it was like macam if i was married on that time right then itll be nice lah cuma one thing about bad about that place its not bad lah i say macam
its almost six years already um we are not uh blessed with a child yet but no matter what im still blessed with uh being with you lah okay so um tapi kan i nak tanya you what was on your mind
ya tapi theres the i mean mostly you like about that lah ah but one thing about him like you tak kasih i you kasih i bebas
kebebasan also so i rasa macam happy lah ha so ya that was why  ya okay that was on your mind lah like responsibilities and stuff like that also right 
the hotel tickets semua kan orang lain dah siapkan dah
some inlaws lah kalau there is i is not pretty and the inlaws dont accept which is to me macam i i thats one of my fear like when i get to know your mum ke apa and then your mum dont like me akan cakap eh asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni sia eh sorry sorry i didnt your mum wont say like that

ya kat arab street t two level lagi
aku takde sleeping punya tu aku takde
 kegiatan riadah
sebab apa 
i feel like the recently i asked people to buy  cause i never buy on my own i feel like everytime uh like that time i ask kesha to buy then i ask the abang ifa ishafi also to buy but then they both say dont have the
 ada satu specific punya that that wagyu sandwich oh
it looks so marvellous macam oh geramya 
why you have to attack me lagi
i feel like downloading because macam ada banyak
rilek ah dont have to be so ganas what
yang at north point ini bagus
 how long have you had them for lama juga kan
 sebab it was literally patty chicken and then put like dua tiga pickles begitu and then the patty again 
but so late sia korang graduate bila
ee yay yay habis your money all gone
buang masa sia dont know how to check directory meh orang dah provide dekat internet
the place you stay at lawn rasa tu ya nope i dont think so
uh i dont know i just nak try dulu sebab i feel like silver necklace macam tak kena sangat because
feel like silver lagi lawa
sebab macam campur dengan peluh ugh cause i always put it like in that in between joints
can dont pemalas or not
of course penat lah tapi kakak ada macam learn untuk menjadi seorang yang berdikari
uh and then habis kotor di lantai ah and then saya haruslah mop
err contohnya seperti uh ada seorang celebrity
err tetapi uh kami sebab kami
so aku cakap its okay for you still want to stay here tapi like end of the month ke apa ah
dia belum move lagi dia cakap dia nak
i dont want to validate this relationship tapi i dont want to say macam eh you cannot hang out with us ah
but then eventually what i did was aku just told him nope i aint gonna participate in this anymore ill just leave the group chat as long as you are still married to her
abeh kalau dia punya bad points aku rasa
she is too deep in this mentality where aku tak tahu its just usually a i told you before we discuss about this before cakap macam
you know they dont have eh eh concrete plan to do whatever lah cause all their life theyve been cushion by their dad financial ke emotionally or both usually both lah
takpe why does it sound like what
ya to me the way actually is very superficial lah eh he said this one line ah aku macam palm his face ah he said you know initially i thought
ah ni ni untuk kau
ya takleh cakap sekarang
i think so but i forgot or you never did i am not sure apa dia apa dia buat
oh as in the whole ah like muis handling the zakat
wasted right and then the uh apa ni  we the we bounce email back and forth back and forth and then ended up you know what my colleague got it
say one week before lah macam like this week right by thursday friday they will tell me my next week schedule to confirm
correct thats why i think my colleague kan dia tak nak she doesnt want to do this uh macam because one thing the part time that the unity one you cannot choose
with aircon and with uh tv thats it tak keluar pun and all these factory workers they are working at night right so they are during the day they are at home
tu dia cakap uh because his pay was uh cut i think about thirty percent eh thirty perc
those who are urgently need to balik kampung or urgently need to go travel for business sign contract or whatever thing right
nothing we dont do anything with krisflyer or anything uh we didnt do any claim lah check punya check rupanya wife dia
ya because the sq fare pun if you take the lowest you cannot claim mileage
no i think its expensive pasal ah its either a different airline or you buy a one way ticket
im sure they have their own bilik tau
cuma kalau dia declare as tourists then they dont need
aah macam jer cause
tak buat apaapa pun ya pasal kita pun tak boleh pakai telephone
simple makanan simple

macam take charge of the scenes semua then i was like eh sia lah uar uar sia aku give kau lesson engkau buat bodoh jer macam tu
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes its like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so  thats why most of the time when you dapat cardiac arrest

the boy baru kena diagnosed mild dyslexia
ya exactly habis kalau dia orang uh macam dekat luar rumah ke apa kan

so kirakan the whole time right dia just  tak buat apaapa  ya then
macam banyak makan gitu then apa the dia kata the
ke five years back

retail abih you try ah apa lagi ah en engineering abih lepas itu
you dont know you nak buat apa
betul juga ah betul juga ah
buat sambal tumis tapi kan tak ada bawang merah tau like theres no onions
so i decided to use bawang putih
so i use garlic and i put like five cloves of garlic and it was to me its a bit too much lah because you can literally rasa the garlicky taste
like a carnival like basically macam
atas tu ada ada movie
kedai kedai kat bawa gitu
where mummy masak me birthday for my sixteenth sixteenth birthday 
no lah but its more of like okay like arrogance as as in macam
i think central kot like
buat apa kalau badan macam sedap gila tapi muka macam haprak
macam like i if i want a sandwich i get a sandwich if i want airpods if i want a pair of airpods i get airpod if i want a laptop i get a laptop
bto and resale and kahwin everything
tapi monday i have to like upload
if i see something i want to develop a bit more and more and more macam you know let it let it branch out
kan i think so i also prefer boost
uh its a bit hard to plan ah i mean we plan for the first and second the third one was kind of planned uh fourth  kira  surprise ah 
mana lagi us ah us is hq lah to will always go there lah
so is a is a is a is a um fully paid trip for seven days  pergi  uh their
a fan lah ah so so that photo was actually  kat  the  their  apa ni  training training ground their training ground so we we had a a s a small football tournament between the winners from other countries
that that that time we  kita pergi  night train from london
jalan from the train the the
banyak orang because they all rush in
basically okay lah dua macam dua alam like malay call it dua alam
ah lah takpe sama i had the nissin seafood one very nice
dah mature a bit lah ah
the whole school his whole cohort dapat tahu that
the girl that used to like my ex uh before my ex and i got together she she hated me lah cause i so called aku rampas dia punya
not spending time i prefer befriending ya i forgot the word befriending dengan lelaki and everything because they very chill sure you need to find the balance between the guy friends lah
setakat aku nak kawan dengan semua orang dalam class so
but she she she never realise because sebagai kawan i never tegur because out of kesian right you know like its your own friend you sayang your friend and everything
but that one i feel like for everyone is normal you know if everyone if everyone if someone just overly control you you would just feel tak sedap hati macam apa sia aku buat aku dengan kau siapa sia kawan jer
okay lah just share share sikit leh dengan
okay thats cute i guess macam abangabang ah gitu kan  abangabang yang bulat  ah um ah betul betul betul
ya but a few people interested but all tak jadi
rumah ni so

err last minute um the the anak couldnt pay for certain things kan
ah macam like those those small things macam like maybe uh venue
because shes okay her ikat tunang
ah ah that one i dont know ah okay dia punya ikat tunang is two years
and then like after that like macam maybe house or what
ya tak
really really like like gila babi sia
aku rasa seven eight dollars ah or even lesser ah five dollars ah maybe sekarang basic haircut jer dah at least dua puluh like twenty dollars like walao eh jialat heavy
entah semua busy semua macam
like take some time off just to do the mixing lah but i think cause that time we prioritise on that first lah cause dah lama gila seh like hold back kita punya recording
dia was working dekat
baru masuk orh baru masuk like i think one month plus two months ah
but then again i think the twenty four hours pun macam can feel the vibe lah pasal you are still macam dekat another country orh then you see like even though macam say for example eh for example kau main germany ah but different parts of germany have different style like that culture is like super different ah
i dont know ah he some pop punkers like feeling feeling tapi macam
then will send us then cakap okay err ni ni ni nak kena tukar sikit ni kena adjust sikit
cause hakim macam dah offer eh next recording aku aku will make sure like all the all the miking will be better lah
aku tahu dia mahal but then im giving you that that green light apa that green light to just go and use instead of
one point five click ah betul
err tak dalam setah aku belaj gunting setahun sahaja lah sa sa satu tahun sahaja

day macam hari ke hari kemudian macam
nak kena mandi  nak kena 
apa ni self esteem dalam melayu apa eh macam 
macam oh aku kena habiskan kerja ni
and not get caught or what macam
macam theres no more industry ther theres no no more music industry right then
stamina dah turun 
how okay in the first place macam mana kau nak focus i im i just
so like he needs to so okay so his power is like literally anything that he touches expected to stone or like or if if someone say its can you like urut me like he would urut and then after that you will just your body whole body just like just becomes a ball because he just his power is just too strong or he kicks someone okay so theres was this one scene
okay yes yes i skip the intro thats what i do you have to skip the intro  so like just one hour straight ill just watch ah saiki it was so good and the thing is i think theres like a couple of seasons i rasa belum habis
kat masjid dia orang and then he received like some questions of people um and its really weird because
uh kalau solat saya kentut bila rakaat ni 
dia cuci rambut tapi dia pakai hijab macam 
and dia punya office shes only be given like know classroom nya table

nasib baik got save save kalau tak save then like teruk sia macam gitu
i dont know she start macam lip gloss punya
okay then lagi siapa lagi dekat sekolah kau
dia tengok dia macam dia tengok dia dah terkejut tau and he was shocked lah then after that he uh but after that he still continue to like me and you know he whenever i say like uh wheres my block my teacher ask wheres your block all abeh he will story to the class dia akan cakap his house is behind my block abeh dia cakap something then teacher ask which school do you wanna go then i say xingnan then he also say xingnan
oh she wear jubah

i know its gonna be tough tapi
i perlukan pertolongan lah in that area
untuk cover muka
tak apa i boleh control kan you
ah dia tak main lah dia main fifa
i rasa that you should
ya som something like that lah like they have a struc uh a grammar structure specific for that language and a grammar structure specific for this language ya so we just study the differences ah ya so thats why they say we cannot understand different languages ah if like you use uh malay then i use english in like i really dont understand malay you dont understand english then like susah
its a translation but then like err one word is before the other or one word is after the other so thats the di thats the thing and  its very complicated to explain cause like for me when i see the like if you want to really analyse right like you theres a lot of different structures and then like err the placement of the words and all that so thats the difficult part ah ya i think there was once i i look err the one that my prof taught me was err apa ni
correct ya cause nanti err it will be natural
ya sebab but its more suited for the mature audience ah
atau grab express uh deliver parcel
 takyah mandi
so next time kalau kita balik india we wont go back to our hometown
and yang help them
no lah but as your active sg engkau boleh check lah i am should have one at jalan besar also dekat jalan besar pun ada

as in kalau kau makan satu pizza sama rasa bosan apa
yes and then kau tahu aku punya kawan inshan kan
duduk office right ya aah
always all the way like that ke pasal covid
uh you dont know anything so i uh that time im just like malas seh nak datang balik 
but then now i i see like macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua i dont know what the hell they are doing but okay lah i guess
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other macam
there was one guy who even like macam
ya so its like macam i feel like if i live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
thats why just like normal expenditure kan its not like saving for a house gitu you know
so just make friends ah because i feel like macam
ive never tried before but because my kereta kan um belakang boleh turun kan
eh itu shiok gila kita baring eh anyways anyways
true lah but i think there are some places some hospital yang macam gitu but aku rasa
okay you know ah that day ah you remember the baju that i wore that day when uh kau ke kita keluar dengan huda and sarah
so semalam i wore that baju when i met haikal
gila siapa nak layan eh
kalau aku pun aku buat gitu
and then i realised the minyak is
boleh swee celebrate a bit
nenek saya pun masuk hospital pun dah beberapa dah beberapa kali pasal sakit pasal jatuh
so kalau ada peluang bahasa arab
dengan stable ah sebab sekarang ini banyak orang hidup susah
betul betul betul betul judgemental kan sekarang
kalau aku boleh tukar aku punya rupa sekarang juga
apa that personality is in someone is more important right like for us as a guy
and um with that both of us would like to say thank you and have a nice day thank you terima kasih bye bye
ya and then but tapi recently kan

apasal you like he is it ee
ah ya ya can you please tell me what happened i want to know nak tahu
aku feel so betrayed
he feels malu because he had to do it so from then on macam it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that dia just start to tak suka me

select you can see like my background kat sini kan you its apa um its virtual screen so maknanya my background takleh nampak lah
bagi lawa lah so i i use this
okay i dont really have it oh dengan yes no
ya so you just have to macam baca betulbetul lah like which one is everyone which one is to you only
i mean technically its in the poem also what so like even if you baca like
promote ah sponsorship ah sponsorship ya so you ask for like you ask this company for sponsorship lah but usually like if its a bigger scale like what like your whole faculty punya goody bag then its usually easier but like for us cause we are just a small apa faculty group kan
i was dengan tengah planning for this fundraising i was thinking like hmm like what other interesting courses would people be interested in
err go back to school to study apa
but its not conducive and then people study like outside yang kat atas semua its so hard
then you said then they said you can apply but your just your application will just be like as though youre a new student so macam tak kira kalau you ada you were accepted like me like in your exchange you will still have to like
uh doing online kalau boleh
but the the new application yang dorang kasi its more
jap jap and then after that like they and then we were like
no next week they will give me the um they have something in mind i think uh ya and then macam ill just
you know next year when they start doing uh the actual work that they do i think the first thing chinese new year bila
too penat uh the but um macam e especially the patient to do anything else so the cancer society sends in volunteers to go to the house
and stuff like that lah so its a lot of things that are happening for them and i think that thats why they regularly have macam apa tu volunteer drive so this was the latest volunteer drive and i signed up for it
so when you say volunteer with spca doing this maknanya you take on the volunteer work with the money as well
tengah tengah this new development kat tengah kat belakang sini
but theyve been developing singapore for how long takkan lah macam sampai sekarang tak tahu
are there i mean ive only seen satu kat sini
like right now the clan from botanic gardens i because i find it hard to believe that that they just macam duduk kat situ aje
oh i i remember dulu dekat the the mrt kat mana tu i dont know what lah it was in the news was it a python
macam similar to sunway lagoon yang dekat kuala lumpur
ah macam slushie itu
tapi bila dalam kat situ kawan cantik angin masuk se se sedawa
wild wild wet i think pergi ingat tak dulu lah

effort have to put in like the kayu have to go through the window
to be uh huh habis tu dia orang punya bracket bracket semua ni kat luar like wiring wiring terjojol macam dulu ke semua kat dalam kan
 oh aku ingat seh aku ingat mcdonalds

the hill or whatever and theres like signs that say climbing blah blah blah so kita okay lah go jer so so kita tak tak pakai benda climbing pun kita pakai jeans kan kita pakai winter coat uh you i remember you were having like the bomber jacket and then we started climbing
kasut biasa and then kita ada makanan kita ada aku tahu aku ada bawa gulagula
oh i remember after when we were going down kan alehaleh ada ramai orang naik betul tak so dorang semua tengok kita orang macam kenapa dorang pakai baju macam gini
weekend kita orang pergi mana
and then err at the end of the whole thing we realised yang apa ni orang yang dalam van kita semua macam lebih mature i would say eh and like our van was like the most diverse diverse group of people and we knew we dont really know each other lah sebelum tu when we started the trip
aku baru nak tanya whats stopping you
i mean dulu aku pernah
panjatpanjat nanti penat
masa tahun depan
even ex players also tell me is i dont know like for leisure leisure okay lah tapi nak
commit and ah macam apa
tapi kau tahu apa lebih teruk tak
let me phrase that ya what apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup
intuition that i can read people face so like i know oh muka gini ah gini ah orangnya
aku tengah tengok dia orang punya question
i mean i heard of it before tapi macam
obviously ah kita macam you know what
kita punya pathway macam gini jer
abeh kalau kat rumah i mean k fine fine its true we are free we are more free
kalau basketball oh definitely ah you need upper body strength ah but that means
no no no k basically in basketball kan kalau kau main
dengan dorang punya sayur
tak kira apaapa lah
you know because uh you have to understand in singapore susah nak dapat natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
untuk orang turun dengan nak masuk kedai <unk> right
okay lah playing sports and all is a different thing lah you need to  you know move because like berapa hari lepas kan aku kat rumah je aku macam dah tak leh tahan
so i just need to get up i i so i went to play takraw kat serangoon sana
but how come oh its the tudung is it is it the tudung like buy us to
no they changing right now i dont know lah the other nephew bising ah
oh my god habis mata dia terbeliak oh my god she like
nampak lah this windbreaker okay those they sold like
habis kat sini ada this flame stuff
 tak actually my size is forty one
but you staycation kat mana seh
you wanna talk about kita punya singapore poly life lah so far
 so kira kan self self nominate kau terus masuk
goes around the school lah tu yang aku tak berapa suka pasal cikgu nanti ada different opinion about the same person
so aku akan kerja all the way
so if anybody interested join staff masuk lah ya so
rezeki tak ada aku tak dapat
fun fact during secondary school i took physics but all my physics class i never go you know where i go i go inside bio class duduk belakang dengar
tak aku nak try my best to go police
and find it boring lah my opinion macam gitugitu jer ya okay lah tengok macam mana
striker yang
pds lah fsd yang jogetjoget sambil marching
ah make the police create the league untuk macam orangorang tak
pemenang dikir barat singapore poly never had that kind of recognition so but i feel like being a captain itself
that that that pada aku tu yang paling penting ah dalam
melayu eh
they went for service punya
macam dah pernah eh
tak tak semua tak semua
inspire me ya something like that because aku tengok kan this one season kan they diorang fail to apa tu uh save this couple tau old couple
diorang rasa macam diorang salah diorang punya salah sebab tu kan
dia cari bapa dia tiga jam pastu last dia pergi that tower where all the lifeguard is there dia cakap uh apa aku tengah cari bapa aku boleh tak buat announcement
surfing surfing board tu diorang sendiri pergi
he just stand there ah just wait for someone to actually bawak body dia masuk
aku kecikkecik aku takde dreams seh
oh my god dia seriously macam udakbudak
dont need to think about it beli kereta jer
apa apa afiq cakap yang guards guards nya motto apa eh
mana lah aku tahu thats why aku tanya
if only aku boleh jumpa bts
because red bullet aku pergi red bullet
hes like sama macam afiq lah ataupun a bit more taller
dengan kawan aku lah like i dont know them but i know them through twitter
tak suka aku tak suka tempat yang very crowded
aku tak suka
just be by myself ah even aku yang first masuk this company that im working for
ask their to to work things out lah i mean like macam you know like how they say if if if youre not really forced willing to try but you are forced to so you know you can see the the if it really works or not lah but i think to a certain extent it can be done you know whether they just want or dont want to
orang melayu ah or like someone who belajar melayu
ada kirakira
i have to really plan macam straight away after finish
ya she she took chemistry in the us pastu um
because im the kind of person yang i cannot tunggu for people
that was last time uh remember i told you there was like one time in between july sampai
i know lah but macam we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
kesian seh
ya im im so interested in that macam i think thats what
ya twenty more minutes sayang
tak nak my brother can get gong cha you want
would it be more macam
but this kind of thing definitely need macam to set up to set aside like at least
ya because like i like i talk to her about macam my trip to yogyakarta the like last year
dorang count kan dorang punya currency besar gila kan
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia sama juga
actually does kakak even know like half the shit that you did in mexico
like macam back th back in ns that time ah
then tolong tolong jer lah make up dengan tukar botol semua
so sixty thirty bangun tengok bawah mendap
wait ko bangun pukul berapa sembilan
as in we were rushing up but tak macam lari tak lari ah just like brisk walk that kind of thing
cause i dont think i dont think anybody would ever get conveyed their fmv ah apa tu <unk>
so then he dont know why okay this part this part is err a bit scary part ah he dont know why but he went to panjat to the downstairs the scary part
if upstairs tak buka then korang downstairs is like even worse its gonna be locked also
seh ah tak boleh baik baik ah
okay ah not bad boleh makan for the rest of my life tapi the downside is aku punya health akan deteriorate rabak
you all need macam diploma degree baru boleh dapat the experience
um thats why ah if like you want to study overseas as a melayu i think kan australia will be the most safest because
you know australia they very open and stuff so like ya but then when you overseas you need to stay in a place where ah the place has accommodates to what you are lah like being a muslim so kalau kau nak tinggal kat korea kau kena tinggal kat itaewon situ ah ah cause i heard situ banyak kebanyakan melayu tapi contradict juga situ juga banyak tempat clubbing
who english is rabak
like nyonyanyonya talking
tak ambil tak jadi ambil
uh memang sama lah
tapi the next morning i buat muka tebal ambil lagi like nothing happen like what like nothing you know he he did nothing to me to
ya lah habis suruh cakap gossip pasal thats why ibu tak nak gossip pasal about kita eh nanti engkau  so i cakap okay gossip about other people lah gossip about artiste lah uh jadi tak tak ada kau tak angry ibu pun tak angry betul tak
nanti dia cakap kurang ajar eh
tak ada baby jangan kasih dia once baby dia nangis eh
ya lah ini pasal engkau nak pergi army kan just book a grab saja lah baru bayar berapa lah uh then balik pun naik grab other than that bila kat rumah
bubur pulut hitam
nanti i cetak  nanti i print lepas tu nanti boleh tampal lah dekat cardboard itu
orang yang uh cucikan sofa
uh huh buat sementara waktu kita boleh letak vinyl dulu kan lepas itu nanti dah ada
dia ada tag hari itu tapi i tak ingat ada dia ada tag uh
dia dia popular juga apa eh nama dia eh tak ingat ah
ya they just give us rough idea theres no three d or whatever pun so
kan so kita boleh jimat banyak sebab apa kan toilet pun kita baru buat cuma maybe kalau tiles itu memang
mm modern juga tapi lampu pun kita dah tukar ingat tak mm
sebab itu kalau you nak buat kitchen saja ini susah memang dia comes together so might as well buat saja
sebab kalau kita sikitsikit you tengok sikitsikit kita buat tiga k habis kalau kerja tak sempurna pun tengok kita pun bingit then end up kita tetap kena buat yang betul punya kan
lepas itu tak boleh ada gap itu hit itu lah dia dah ini merekah lah itu
ya but is it your own your own punya feeling or memang they are the one who gave you hints
uh apa eh
he will always pick up then then we were talking then she was like okay uh apa you wouldnt believe it we wanna go tampines hub also naik motor
dia by six sudah tutup i think
ive never eaten there right so i ask him agak agak berapa ah kena bayar like how much is the
yeah then i was like ma masa tu i busy
i also macam dont feel like how i would feel last time ill be sad if i never i cannot make it you know
tapi three three people is still not bad
you know you know the line that guy like uh apa guys like to use or like they bs ah basically he said uh dia dm the girl that eh hari tu i saw you at
last time he used to be a bit panas baran if he dont like someone
susah
 asal  boring what you doing at home
i dont know why i was daring to try that deer meat lah  you know cause like im there already so  mak  i say just try something new because i like to explore what i like to try new food
uh huh dah  tembam 
kau macam mana eh
so like um for me i i pick the shipyard job ah because i heard of like very good like uh what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing ah because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing uh bila kau sail kan uh macam
then macam
ah apa our school work ah ya
more with macam err people ah online people online ah like strangers you know not in not strangers lah
ah its damn hot then you thirsty then you want to makan right
its more to macam satisfactory lah unex unexpectedly good 
malas abeh ah tiring lagi so macam
 oh for mine like the maximum like the longest longest exam that i had was like ah twenty four hours ah so i cannot imagine like forty eight hours was like huh forty eight hours lama gila
ah for like for each question err um my lecturer specified ah like um berapa banyak words
we had to like really um arrange like how do i how do we answer it like to meet the requirements so it was like um  time consuming lah ah which explains why maybe she like kasi us twenty four hours untuk buat
cause like you know you know there are times like um uh like i i attended like online lectures but then like macam like i was there but i was asleep
working team members which was hard lah cause i mean you know assignments are like supposed its very heavy and its supposed to be like macam equally divided kan tapi like like the pressure was more on like the lesser lesser working members the more work needs to be done right for each member
mm or the like apa tu cerita dia like is it
especially kalau cerita dia romance kan oh lagi malas  no no no tak boleh i i really
sometimes i watch like like really random ah like i can be watching macam ah ill be watching like cooking shows or ya to like macam makeup stuff
no matter like how much im updated with whats going on i feel like im still dont have enough knowledge like like the lack of knowledge in me to really macam go out there and speak up about things like this ah
my my twitter is like private like private account tapi
for okay bila comes to like my love life right i im the type of person yang if we vibe we vibe ah so if like from the start if we cant really click then i dont think that thats like hope in it so i will just like you know what its not its not happening so ya so to be matchmake right mm  i think for someone like me its gonna be hard lah  its gonna be very hard
 so macam i dont know im so like to answer your question i tak sure ah whether i can actually
 ya ya ya malas ah
eh ya that day you dont even know what is the what is the translation for butterfly eh was it you or me ah i remember somebody say butterfly is ramarama but then like i legit thought its i say one but then like now that i think about it right maybe its you said one eh then i thought huh really 
you get certain score and all that then doesnt make you eligible to masuk like
tak wasted lah ya i really get to use it to
maybe go to the beach pergi jogging ke
so kalau nak pergi beach pun err tak jauh sangat
 eh last time dulu aku ns papa pun buat ini buat ini like last
my family also ikut pergi sampai tekong and then they all
mum and dad adik and my ab eh my adik
the idea is that err kalau we stay longer kat dalam camp
no i mean its like sometimes its like eh you want to go eat its a its a its a its not im not necessarily lapar or anything
usually kita beli what err just nasi campur
nasi padang and the asagani stall
hey it was a super spicy nasi goreng
 bulan puasa bro
when i made the err the whole aduan right it was a bit
i stay in the east area then this amshar pula tinggal kat
apa woodlands kan jauh gila so obviously
actually this kind of thing also honestly i a bit kekok but but why did the the baking thing was that
tak masuk akal lah for me to eat everything oh what
but then err aku pun tak nak susahkan dia orang right
ya ambil hati also then they also tak nak
eh bila nak staycay kata nak staycay
nak kena macam put as a
 like one of the video then they like talk about like eh later makan apa semua like all the standard ah
kalau try jer
you think ni boleh make it tak
um no lah later people listen to this like what the like merepek sia
takde tu lah
because there are two factors you need to think first um kita tak nak mengecewakan hati siapa siapa pihak because you all just become a new family member second
um i think quite i i would say i like macam drag it lah but i think about it because in the end like we dont really can afford even for exchange of hantaran i think in the end
uh constrain the constraints of it then from there you workout on it lah so lets talk about happy things lah macam stress jer cerita cerita macam begini kita buat cerita cerita happy pulak dalam pasal pasal wedding ni
then okay loh kalau tak boleh oh too bad lah because um either or i think theres only some loss factor for example if they use option one
then after that then thats it lah finish okay dah tak ada lagi lah that is the the the point of it ya so that is one of it
then that means but you prefer you talk to your parents both of you like macam tahu okay kita ada this amount kita ada ni kita boleh prepare macam ini ah then ah
on the table then after that err you apa ni
ah so mas kahwin is part of the err macam dalam dalam term dia dalam arab is called maha
thats why i said despite the whole thing now seems already dah pening kepala lah kan like very um you know so you you just got to doa for awhile rilek you know dont need to think
you mean the hantaran
or can be just a cheque amount ya that is one thing of it lah ya if you ask me can be cheque kosong ha ha ha ha
per per per person or individual like that like macam tak tunjuk lah kan macam
um when you work you have to think is i always remind thats why like when when when my anak when all of you come to me my anak anak saudara ask me about wedding
is not as if you are not able to pay thats the only thing lah ah because memang ah kalau memang kita ada segalanya memang ah kalau kita anak anak sultan johor ke daughters sultan daughters of sultan johor can lah

corona virus thing err dulu back then i was somewhat employed lah
um slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between theres a lot of doubt banyak orang orang macam didnt quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
tapi because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this covid situation is um what she should have done was
tapi she chose to macam go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy theres a lot of
prepare food quickly kedai mana prepare food very slow they know how to play the game lah basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize macam your delivery ah
chances are and even theres rich people macam err  beli kopi   just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
ah kena pakai lesen you have to prove your lesen lah but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you dont need to
duduk kat rumah jadi beban jer puas hati macam you go out earn whatever little money you can and i saw this uh girl this malay girl in a wheelchair lah
so macam berdikari lah so instead of
and you dont have that burden of oh hari ini kena buat sepuluh delivery for example no you earn how much you get thats yours
what sort of err security feature or identification yang dorang implement
or facebook ada politics pe sekolah pun ada politics pe but one thing i okay so just to do a very very
in school walaupun you dont have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever belajar but apparently you always have this
two major popular universities that they went to is either rmit or eh uol so uol macam sekolah so basically you study throughout the whole year
you know macam when youre home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area

and nasib is the birthday present that i have been wanting for quite some time it was a kasut nike like this specific kasut yang
was quite mahal lah actually so they managed to everybody chip in some money and then they bought this kasut that i think was about dua ratus lebih this pair of nike shoes
vouchers like it can be macam adidas voucher it can be capitaland mall vou vouchers can be nike vouchers ah pergilah kau apa kau nak beli
instead of having macam a very good time and macam shiok sendiri
and i so i feel like kalau like you want to have a this macam grand gestures right you need to kena fikir where you want to have your your birthday present where sorry where you want to have your birthday celebration until macam sakit kepala lah you have to think
nobody saw it coming macam time covid you cannot go anywhere man you have to stay in singapore you have to celebrate your birthday in singapore but of course it will be more gerek lah if you can celebrate your birthday in bali or something watching the sunset or sunrise that one confirm more gerek sia

ya tu ah i think ah that time i pergi in twenty
so kita dalam kat new zealand maybe about one or two
my cousin and kita pergi pub
tu bukan lah tu some pumpkin spice kan
kalau nak lagi rilek
kalau bawa kereta sendiri then you might as just i mean i dont know just travel all the way but
took a slightly more i mean the seas were ruffled lah kan when i think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat lah
then bila pagi dah bangun
oh dapat dia orang yang burger ni macam best ah
which i am inclined to agree sebab about i havent tasted
tak pada i macam lebih pada okay like
so nandos kan macam oh nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam up sikit
betul juga okay lah maybe i think oh what was
york yang kita punya kita punya camper van um battery mati
mahal lah i think
fifty alah fifty australian fifty sing ni lebih kurang sama ah
maze kat sana ah
cuaca dia orang memang sejuk so kita tak rasa sangat ah
err at that time two thousand eight tak salah tengah euro euro two thousand eight ya tu ah euro two thousand eight lah
atau kita ambil um kita ambil apa the the budget flight ah
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but i will switch on my meter and nanti i will show you all
lepas tu he said
jalan ah
so kita turun kat kedai muslim ni kita kebetulan found a muslim shop which was nearby
so kita duadua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik
kita dah kat madrid eh dia orang bual bual melayu eh muka bangladesh berbual melayu lepak
ya then you have to wait lah queue then wait for the aunty to like okay adik berapa orang okay dua orang duduk okay ah
i also dont know lah but he look i call him adik cause its just an insult to him can you imagine if its if you you talk to him ah adik nasi ayam dua i tell you itll be so insulting
not being very friendly because weve always had our encounters with uh female punya shopkeeper yang macam fierce and garang right
i like d apa tu make your own plans lah as
i mean if dont have also you can always pergi dengan
mm mm so ya lah nak kena kena actually call or inform at least just to check
no never because i think because of location macam
oh okay okay tahu tahu aah tahu tahu okay okay
daripada dorang ada buat merepek ni then you like ah korang minta kena sepak
ya that one she does it repeat she did it repeatedly kalau you want to talk about jail then she should be jailed because like first time tak serik second time tak serik
ya lah but the thing is it still has to be fair for everyone lah like got the first time okay kalau kau buat lagi then thats it kau minta kena sepak you know that kind of thing
th no the thing is adela they have different arrangement adela so macam like offices right now right they said ah cannot have more than fifty employees at one time
i think no lah maybe just because like i dont know maybe dorang main game and then its nice to talk and because its really a place for you to macam vent you know dekat rumah you know that kind of thing
its literally macam cucuk selah 
takut bilang kau that time
no its very fast its not even five minutes its lesser than that cuma like the initial part a bit painful lah
you know tak it think about it you its for your health so you just do it its very fast the cepat and you get the result on the spot also
half half macam  macam fifty percent punya reflection journal aah ya it was just a fifty fifty then i just submit
because ya so they are she interacted with her supervisors or like the one that yang assigned dia through
ya so diam so ah so bila masuk poly tibatiba dah kena buat ah share document and all that then i was like apa ni apa ni i dont know i dont know i dont know or like on the first day it was just like macam
i had to do most of the things that macam
and it was because of a vote class voting at the starting of the year so right for the whole secondary years i became the monitor slash monitress secondary one lah the four years lah it was chosen by the form teacher because the form teacher knew you so apparently so apparently like kakak was the major contribution why i became like the
even when macam ah the teachers like complain about us and then our class macam ah its okay its okay its our class like that  even like the teachers
but then like for the lower class right dorang like stay back like almost everyday then is like one thing kesian juga macam like everyone akan tengok ya but then but the thing i hated the most because kita orang the first two class couldnt like they didnt apply us for apex camp
during primary six no because kita orang macam macam ah okay ah tak payah apex camp no i am more of a person of yang tak suka interact bukan antisocial
so means dorang stay back longer than kau stay back ah
i dont know i dont know what the guys did but it was a punishment suddenly there were like suddenly tibatiba ada empat orang pun apa lari to the gate and go to the parade square just stand there for like probably ten minutes it was a punishment but i dont know what they did ah but i think was something stupid or they did it just like ya i i think that they did it just like tak tidur so the rest kena punishment but then right i think the male teachers like macam
and it was all girls lah but dah tak ada lelaki so ah ah oh then suddenly like two of us macam nak beli makanan and because it was during lunchtime and dah penat ah so okay lah the so it was left with me and another one friend lah kat dalam
kita orang diam kita orang like give each other a look ah then like okay ah how about we just like macam macam
bukan application lah it was just a website kita orang ini so kita orang enter macam this group im in that kira macam game pin
then the masuk no no it was not telegram it was just a website ah so macam dah gitu so they will assign the mafia or the spy gitu so for that game we had to question each other lah like okay so ah what is this place this place have like
pusing ah pusing tengok then i was like theres no guy theres no one
then i was like because um im quite macam rapat juga ah primary six and our class is at the eight level which is the highest level and
not so clear like hes like just like macam bayang
and dia pakai baju black clothes clothing dont dont dont dont then okay okay then i ask my friend lah
and until now it last ramai of my other friends macam kita dah macam you know after that macam dah start to putik putus but with you and err err our friends yest yesterday it is a long lasting macam kita tak awkward tau and that that is something that i see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever inshaallah
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what i what i see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know kita punya chemistry kita punya behaviour
like fashion wise you know is it oh damn okay i think i get what you mean some my my course pun ada juga yang those type of cliques that
this we can say about our macam okay in the future kalau you nak cari um
nak trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what i mean
unless kita kes yang macam our confidence level is very high ya but of course
i think kan for me okay kita kita perempuan kan but i i think um generally generally speaking kan i think its the girls is it but not me lah
ya ya ya macam in terms of gossiping also lah you can say that dia orang macam more towards okay maybe gaming or like like like
betul tak
lum lumrah lah eh memang memang its the world lah its just it evolve like this lah to be honest mesti there is there is gonna be uh plus minus there plus minus macam you know macam kau tahu okay uh dunia hiburan
their personality whether they are they good people sebab ada jer yang news turns out that oh this idol did this this idol did this its a bad thing but then the fans tak boleh tak boleh percaya tu the fans doesnt uh
macam kau tahu kan dulu uh okay zaman sekarang right you know if you were to just wear like uh sloppy
you can you can follow whatever you want tapi kalau you have that mindset of because i wanna look cool i think that is not the right thing err you know what i mean why say you you if you want to dress up because you you you
so macam you know like um you know they say theres a saying macam uh everybody goes comes with you but cant go with you its like macam macam mana eh like
where you stand macam mana you know what i mean like if you are going towards that big group macam tadi kau cakap
as long as its of of a good value then by all means go ahead macam if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your macam it will lead you to a success atau macam lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead sebab if you know the circle of friends is good
kalau aku takde kawan then im not gonna im not desperate for friends like i just i i mean you know there are some people
and i have my own uh pendirian daripada
theres nothing wrong uh he he or she is of a good uh direction even if the person is alone go ahead i i woul kita support aku support tapi kalau
let what people think go ahead society if society doesnt like you or doesnt like what you wear or doesnt like your face or whatever right they they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to to to degrade you whatever but kalau you its hard its hard to say macam for me you know i just say but if i were to
but you are successful kau
kau chairperson seh kau your leadership skill is really aku sanjung aku macam aku tabik err sebab your leadership is the best
kawan macam kau boleh gang dengan kita go ahead like come advice kita takde macam

ya and bus kat that that bus nine seven five tu oh my god
i pergi sengkang punya mp

ya so i dah bayar dorang
dorang tak tak wish
tak boleh 
i ada i tanya kenapa you cakap gitu
no lah entah eh he she knows i have my own perangai he has his own perangai also macam when we quarrel or apa
i saw uh cause it was at night malammalam so aku saw this lady
dia dalam gelap
measures no uh no as in in terms of the zones like for your school kau ada zone like different different zones
but the thing is mala at causeway point macam mahal gila
dorang take in like
my course is so filled with so many smart people  aku macam so intimidated
i mean kau ada
not in the social work ah kan aku bilang kau social service organisations semua
tapi uh elisa like dia explain to aku like dia punya how
then kau jangan kau jangan tengok video dia lah its like shes not forcing you to watch her video
kat rumah the whole time so i didnt like really was like
and then suddenly aku macam like so like scared
was it because of anxiety or apa
best punya
kau ya nak nampak nak tengok what what is
so everyone takut sebab you know you saw the tiktok yang dorang steal your information tu
so kalau kau in the middle of the night cakap  huda kau nak main animal crossing im like
its called corduroy pants dengan ni
every assignment aku mesti buat sebab its like analyse this company im like mm  do i have to
or maybe bila my instructor bilang aku untuk book sendiri
kau fake pe kau only love someone if they love you back
of course korang best korang best friend
and shes she expect all these guys to have like a stable job when apa dorang kat poly ke serving ns
you know kita tengah sekolah
uh i would put it inside the washing machine then i would tu ya wash
and thats because sebab dulu like basuh basuh basuh basuh so its like
then after that the guy was like orh okay ah okay okay okay betul betul betul then after that i was like okay i jsut say ah terima kasih lah then after that that fellow say kasih then after that he walk away i look at my friend say eh <ex2>chao chibai</ex2> fellow i tell you to put the fucking vape in hide it inside why you put in your pocket after that he say eh brother i dont know lah brother i dont know this type of thing i say you idiot sia go and stare at the policeman for fuck also i dont know
tapi kalau smelly as fuck bau macam tong sampah you can be near that person meh you can see from far only what whats the point then
ya i know lah but tu sebab
eh mana buttercup
high likely kau yang patut kena kacau asal kita orang pula yang kena
tu ustaz tu pula nanti kita jadi isteri nombor sembilan dengan sepuluh tak nak ah
no china people bela me man
telur with kicap
nasal yang hidung punya voice
but um do you think macam you have gone yo you think kau sudah pergi quite far juga eh
aku rasa tenang ah macam biasa ah
aku rasa at this point of time pasal kita orang kena
apasal kau tak nak main basikal
like recently aku just started cycle daripada where aku ah
macam apa selalu kau buat on saturday
in the night probably kalau ada kereta
meaning macam really semua orang dah sakit and then
make them to kind of macam stop from
you can have time untuk
tak ada benda yang yang kau belajar
mm i think for me kalau recommendation i recommend just nearby kalau since youre going out already might as well pergi to err minang minang
okay how ah macam how to check in how know contact tracing lah this and that and then after that after awhile
dah membara you know like dah lapar abeh dah mengamuk
eh eh baiknya lah eh eh siapa seh tak nak pergi rumah dia gitu as in tip in cash or huh oh my god
so altogether maybe about empat puluh packet they just put you know lah
ah ah so also kelakar lah because okay lah kalau macam restaurant maybe
correct and then nasi i mean okay nasi padang eh maybe on average maybe about five dollars but during the fasting month eh plus the delivery and everything my my friend paid about hundred plus tau then imagine half of the nasi basi macam mana gitu
okay lah boleh lah hopefully tak hujan seh sekarang kalau weather you know lah macam unpredictable that day punya lah panas i think i check the temperature you know whats the temperature thirty four degrees seh thirty four degrees tapi
at the bus stop dia punya orang is standing on the seat eh
he just drink water a lot everyday because dia tak ada medicine for dengue theres no cure just like covid nineteen scary ah
and its like during a pandemic and then like you dont see the end you know like every other day mesti ada something you know and its only what august oh my god
mm ya a lot of a lot of emphasis is on work life balance nowadays ah i mean you tengok ah kalau
kelakar right its really like three hundred and sixty degrees eh completely different like but the  i guess now people just have to accept what is the new normal lah you know what i mean
every every singaporean loves you know mm mm like that day apa tu baru national day weekend like most of the time like thousands of flights will go and that day somebody uploaded online like i think only seven flights went off during that long national day weekend
once every four years right mm mm millions of dollars also the amount of money imagine all the duit
macammacam perasaan tapi at the end of the day mesti positive lah you know kalau tak positive susah seh i mean harihari takkan i mean the thing is that
bukannya mahal ke the mask ada i think what less than one dollar you can get already
and then sikit sikit
ibu try to li angkat full pack masuk dalam back of car belakang kereta
and like is all the way movement exercise tembak tembak tembak and then under the hot weather our exercises was was like three to four times because panas sangat
no is not actually kotor is
is like whenever i see someone else tengah pakai tiktok kan especially the lambang kan
and then nanti like someone will just say
eh nak pakai tiktok pakai earpiece ah diam ah irritating ah
tak tahu asal lah but like instagram more revealing is is quite a thing ah people like really follow they find inspiration from it and
at the subject punya nak ambil gambar tu and then when you raise your hand to block the light kan dia tak ada macam harsh shadows when you cover your hand nanti the the shadow is like very soft
then you should go and check review lah thats why i told you youtube is the best kan tengok full circle tengok patah balik youtube juga you know there is a story about this olympic athlete
apa prefect prefect primary and secondary ah ya
dia dah cakap lepas tu they leave the security guard feel okay maybe this one is just a problematic customer lah
like itll be nice if he would i mean like for me i think he would feel that its nice if you could send him off you know you know i mean macam like bila dia dia dah nak meninggal kan habis you ada kat sana
lagipun dia ada banyak family around here daddy is swag
like my um my side of the family is like kalau ada kerja kahwin or kenduri right my family will be the one as helping the rest of the family near extended family they be like the women will be busy makeup lah blah blah blah all that shit im like
i dont think thats how you should behave lah because then you see the core of your personality you know lepas tu like this particular cousins they are like always
like satu ha dia like dah lama tak kerja and hes just err waiting for government to give him money
lepas tu my my my my my my brother just had to bloody say that uh oh kawan dia actually kaya dia macam from a well to do family lah lah lah lah
until my step mum macam berasa macam bersalah lepas tu dia cakap oh nanti err ni siapa dah kasih duit siapa dah kasih duit
ya he no the thing is that he wants to count right after you say he will say things like can buy these can buy that sekarang can buy this can buy that and then like somehow right we will see the underlying err meaning macam actually bila kasih i duit macam gitu
so macam  i dont know man its like
ada kat google my i think im my punya google photo ada berapa banyak gambar kita all this you can make it uh as a oh ya ya ya yes
about the pub ada ada water utilities right you have to go cc something like that and everything uh under under that lah so make sure yang siapa yang nak kahwin uh kat you know void deck ke apa kan make sure you do your planning well im talking about the place ah ya
kan that time wow that time i macam ada crusader datang tapi tu semua dah plan lah so i cannot use my proceed kompang macam macam lainlain team pula kalau tak i smile i tak ada  uh plan but it goes well
tak cakap pun ni semua jadi sendiri eh  i was like happy ah my brother was there uh my adik was there with me dia dia yang plan macam mana dia punya line up so i was uh wow thats my first time tau i tak macam prepare all this eh asal my brother know ah ah that time ya brothers are quite okay lah my best man there that time
talking about the ballroom lets say ah you want to go to the what orange ballroom kita tak boleh makan ke
dah apa dah stand down everything then
tapi dia tak expose dia punya marah tu kat airport so we plan that was macam i literally divert tau pergi malaysia
a few places lah banyak oh ada juga eh oh
pasal i i choose this what
if i know i being i do that now macam sekarang kan baru nak menyesal then were going backward
see my wife jalanjalan makan dengan dia orang semua ya my wife is very fair very fair so we have this uh fairness lah ha so vice versa if for me kalau apa yang dia buat tu tak salah kan dalam segi undangundang and dengan undangundang agama then why not just try lah so try something new cause dia try something new ni kadangkadang  dia tak boleh macam
a lot of things all or way we can uh do business ke apa ke so you have to try it out
if they if he tegur then its not my problem what
ada yang buat worse than me
orang dah tegur then after that what about those kids yang like they are considered macam baby baby gitu still kena raped what
kau orang tiga
kita kita all he talked about was the guys that hit him up im like ya
macam budakbudak like you know then im like
abeh aku cakap nevermind later you go home you text me

very blur aku sepak actually at the end of the day aku tanya kau kau nak ikut besok
he said what layer layer layer aku cakap am i not layering that one
nanti lelaki will think otherwise that one that that one i dont mind
tu pasal aku dah macam marah  thats why i was pissed

its just one line dah tu jer
aku ada buat salah ke
mm itu sebab apa because that one time i suddenly change ah i just suddenly like that tak pakai tudung

like because we ignored it right macam kau try to avoid it thats why dia dah malas nak cakap

i think i think i understand what the commando thing is because set lins brother was like commando in ya in ns its kind of ironic because theyre not singaporean but you know as in like they werent born in singapore ya ya theyre burmese oh ya ya ya ya ya thats why his name is so weird set lin  ya then um they became singaporean like they got singaporean citizenship then his brother was commando then uh if im not wrong right they are the ones who are most likely to risk their life when it comes when its like going to be war lah like theyre the ones doing the more dangerous stuff so thats why like when people do ns thats what thats thats usually what they think about lor its like do i really want to risk my life for this certain role its a good role like theres a lot of honour that comes with it but also like a lot of thought lah like what if singapore actually does goes go to war then you know macam sedih lah to see to have your mother worry about you you know while theyre back home ya then i remember at headrock
ya then she but they always tried to have lauk lah like uh even back then you know
tak tak ada tanya never err call you is it

boleh customise lah sebab kita tak nak macam idea macam mana eh kita nak every gift tu comes with thought
ah betul macam apa konjac mee tu kan
what is your advice for a startup  macam angah
betul err and i agree that sometimes when we pro procrastinate actually the result turns out to be better faham ke macam like very last minute tapi it push us to to make a better thing faham ke ya thats true but
internet internet ni they works in a very interesting way
hmm boleh boleh set dekat phone i think we can also keep track lah on that day how many how many time on the day how many time how many hours
kan i think that this is how we would faham ke
takkan dia tak pernah dengar lagi 
ah thats what i was thinking about catio tu dekat hujung sekali depan tu swimming pool
tapi tapi tapi pasal steward and stewardess ni kan ada cadangan untuk bawa
employer pun tak semestinya nak ambil kerja dalam waktu sekarang
because artist ni orang akan minat dia sebab character yang dia bawa dalam drama character dia bawa dalam movie but influencer ni orang minat dia apa atas apa hidup dia faham ke so thats why people lagi look up to influencer daripada
i want all of us to be involved together in everything that we do faham ke yes macam
they were the kind i dont know what is it called in english but its called ayam serama
left hander makan tangan kanan pe
okay so basically its macam uh its a video where i go to places thats really cheap and at the same time its affordable for students like students themselves

around the middle of the month our pay is around the middle of the month so uh i dont want the giro to deduct at the end of the month cause i just afraid that eh sekali ah the the amount is not enough or i have overspent
thats true like singaporean nowadays they have this kind of problem i mean foreigners you know dekat um
like you say you want them to rest you just focus on discipline macam tak kisah dorang buat apa  but then
talk at all you masuk bilik
masuk belajar

and nampak bapa dia dekat old folks home

ya so because of that rant dia bagi like duit to undergo surgery then when the surgery tu was successful
sakitkan hati perempuan tu
bila part dia nak pergi kat perempuan tu dia kena stabbed
apa ni like
no i mean like if i explain all obviously like it doesnt really make sense lah but then if you tengok the trailer is already so sad ya thats like the the movie yang like made me cry so bad
here ya actually like i mean like what this was like the whole year this year ive been like watching just like k drama everyday even me and kakak and abang also like watch everyday like at the tv
start a cafe but i know that in singapore is like very mahal like like you want to the rent all is like its not cheap
i mean its getting better lah ah then like tengok neighbouring neighbouring countries is like we thought that they would they were doing like better than us then look look where they are now
